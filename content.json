Maybe there would be a Sherlock and a John, staying at 221B Baker Street forever and ever. Together. AU where the business with Moriarty never came up and Sherlock did go to Eastern Europe. And never came back. Chapter 1: Invincible Defeat Sherlock leaves John's wedding as early as he can manage and goes back to 221B. The key turns, the front door opens with a squeak. Seventeen steps. He opens the door and walks into the sitting room, taking off his coat and hanging it behind the door along the way. The dim light of streetlamps seeps through the windows. He gets away at last, back here alone in the familiar darkness, turns out what awaits him isn't relief. His eyes roam aimlessly and stop on the wall. Oh. His crime wall, full of paper and notes stuck and pinned on it, as if he were on a case: wedding plans, photos of the venue, caterers, all the obnoxious trivia.Sherlock sits on the floor facing the wall, coffee table in between, and stares at it numbly.Mary's voice going on and on about the wedding flashes back in his mind, distant and obscure. It's over. He wanted the wedding to be perfect for John. Everything went relatively well, a little incident occurred but didn't quite mess it up anyhow. It's over. It's all over. Everything is fucking over. Though he still has a place in John's life, he's lost him already. End of an era. Beginning of a new chapter. No matter how he denies, he's perfectly aware of that. He feels hollowed out, nothing but agony left settling in his chest.However ironic, he planned it all. In more than one sense.It's pretty much his own doing, really. Perhaps this day was determined back when he and Mycroft decided to dismantle Moriarty's network. He was just too stupid to see that far, he didn't even consider whether John was going to wait for him.But if he had known this was bound to come, what choice would there be for him?Sherlock laughs, slightly hysterical. He still pines for John, ridiculous as it is, when he knows he doesn't deserve John, when he knows John now belongs to someone else. John ruined being alone for him.His ability to see things in the dark stabs him in the back this time, he thinks somewhat detachedly.If he weren't such an imbecile, he would've discovered long ago he couldn't do without John. He should've realized that before he jumped off the roof of St Bart's. He should have told John, and maybe, just maybe, John couldn't do without him, either. At the time, at least.But it's too late now, isn't it.Sherlock doesn't know how long he sits there until the dawn breaks. He stands up, his whole body stiff and sore from staying in the same position for too long, walks around the coffee table instead of stepping on it and goes to the crime wall to take everything down, one by one.A day later he moves John's chair upstairs. I love you. He doesn't say it, not even when he says goodbye to John. It was too late when he found it out himself.\"Actually, I can't think of a single thing to say. \"\"No, neither can I. \"Coward, Sherlock sneers at himself. Everything sits heavy in his chest. It might be the final mystery he can unveil in front of John, an answer completely unexpected yet somehow reasonable. But his customary dramatic methods are now useless. It's too simple an confession, no way to flourish or exaggerate it. What he wants to say stubbornly stays stuck in his throat. How he despised those people hesitating and struggling in the face of such things all along - it seems he's no exception.His mind is racing - to no avail - and he gets desperate. He doesn't know how to even open his mouth, verging on a panic. Calm down. He subconsciously takes in every detail and files them all, temperature, wind speed, every subtle change in John's expression. I love you. \"The game is over. \"\"The game is never over, John... \"Sherlock never knows how to say goodbye. He starts babbling. East wind, Mycroft, six months. Roughly six months till his death. My brother estimates. He's never wrong. Say what you have to say. Tell him. Tell him.It's probably for the best if John doesn't know... but it's nigh impossible for him to see John again.He conjures up a little courage. \"John, there's something... I should say, I, I've meant to say always and then never have. Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again, I might as well say it now. \"Those three little words are on the tip of his tongue when another kind of fear captures him all of a sudden. He can't tell John. He can't. If he tells John, it'll be too final and John will know he's... John will know he's going to die, and John absolutely can't know about this. He knows there's anger beneath John's distress, anger towards Sherlock leaving, towards everything that happened, and John probably won't forgive him this time, but he can have that. It's still better than John knowing he's going to die. He can't put John through this again, the grief, the guilt, the pain that Sherlock made him bear those two years for nothing. He never expected it to affect John that much, hadn't seen for himself until he came back - of course, there're simply too many things beyond his expectations.John will come to face his absence with ease. He will, in the end, disappear from John's thoughts and become a story. A memory.It's not up to him and there's no coming back. He knows he has thrown his life away - not that there's much to throw away without John, to begin with - and he knows it from the start, from the moment he decided to shoot Magnussen. A quick decision in three seconds, but there's no remorse. Everything for John.So no. He can't tell John.He took a deep breath. I love you. \"Sherlock is actually a girl's name. \"John laughs, and Sherlock can't help but smile. First time in days, for both of them. Wouldn't it be a comfort, to have John's laughter in the last memory they share?\"It's not. \"\"It was worth a try. \"\"We're not naming our daughter after you. \"\"Oh, I think it could work. \"John will forget him, he sure will as time goes by. It will be better if he does, yes, but... Sherlock just desperately, desperately hopes John won't forget him. It's not really a joke. Maybe you'll name the baby after me and remember me fondly, you're likely the only one who will. Just to think he will never get to see John's little girl...to think if she's named Sherlock Watson. The irony of it.Sherlock takes off his glove and holds out his hand.\"To the very best of times, John. \"John glances down at Sherlock's hand and then looks up, eyes shifting between Sherlock's hand and face. At last he cocks his head a little bit, looks right into Sherlock's eyes and takes Sherlock's hand.Ah, he's disappointed. Sherlock can see, but what can he do? One step more and Sherlock will frantically grab at what doesn't belong to him and John will know. It's too late now.He holds John's hand. This will be how he remembers the sensation of touching John's skin - warm, real, and a dull pain shooting through Sherlock's body.***John's hand is released. He watches Sherlock turn and leave. So that's all, then?John takes a little step without thinking. Closer, just get closer. Maybe a pat on Sherlock's shoulder, maybe another hug... and it wouldn't be enough. It would never be enough. But John refrains. Sherlock doesn't look back. He walks farther and farther away and gets on board. John just stares, steps aways to stand with Mary.So this is it.Sherlock is leaving again. For some undercover work in Eastern Europe, or so he says, and he's going to continue his bloody adventures God-knows-where afterwards, going where John cannot follow.John knows Sherlock has to leave because of him. The idiot claimed not to be a hero but simply flung caution to the winds and shot Magnussen, taking such a risk all on his own. John knows he should be grateful, things would get completely out of hand if not for Sherlock, however...John is supposed to bear it all with him, isn't he? Two of them against the world, fighting by each other's side, until the very end? Sherlock just takes that decision away from John, pushing John away and making himself a bloody martyr. Should it came to that, John would go down with Sherlock and never flinch a bit, he would, while Sherlock dismissed that. John feels hurt. Did Sherlock choose to simply ignore John's thoughts? Does he think John needs protecting?Who does he think he is, making a decision like that?It's not fair to think so, John knows. Sherlock did this for him, deliberately not making him choose. John has his own responsibilities now, he has Mary, he has a family. It's not Sherlock's fault, Sherlock did everything he could.John knows. But he can't simply congratulate himself on his luck and get on with his life as if nothing happened, while everything is fucking upside down. He can't watch Sherlock leave, thinking maybe he could have done something to stop that. He just can't.There's nothing to be done now.He retreats to a safe place, watching the plane take off and leave. Mary seized his hand. Sherlock is gone, once again, leaving John's life. But this time it's different, isn't it? His friend will continue his own life thousands of miles away, be the incredible genius that he is and think of John occasionally. He might miss John, even.That's a relief. That's enough.John keeps telling himself that's enough, watches the plane fly away and desperately wants it to turn back. He wants Sherlock back. The rest of the world can go to hell, it won't even matter if Moriarty comes back to life. But that's impossible. The plane's flying farther, shrinking into a tiny black spot. Bastard, leaving me behind again. Wherever you're going, take care. Maybe I'll miss you. Damn, I'm definitely gonna miss you. Chapter 2: As If It's Real John starts dreaming of Sherlock again.Time and time again he finds himself following Sherlock down the streets and alleyways in his dreams, blood rushing in his ears, gun tucked in the back of his trousers, legs sore from all the running, but he's blazing. They're invincible. Whenever his attention drifts away for even a millisecond, though, Sherlock vanishes.In the end John chooses the baby's name. In the end, and in a way, she actually is named after Sherlock, though Mary doesn't know. John named his daughter Wilda, Mary agreed.When John has her in his arms for the first time, looking at the tiny miracle, he feels vaguely at loss despite his joy.John stares at the laptop screen. He clicks open the edit page of his blog and sits there dumb. He doesn't know what to write. He feels like he should write something, to give himself closure at least. To the public Sherlock is missing, people were asking after Sherlock in the comments, for some time there were even journalists following him everywhere, but the fuss died down eventually and then there was nothing. Nothing.He doesn't really care. Sherlock is just another fancy story to them. New things come up and people lose their interest.It's been almost a year since the last update. Well, not even his update, it was the nonsense Sherlock posted, hacking his account and all. That's more like Sherlock. Frankly, John could't believe Sherlock was so...serious at his wedding.It was most probably the happiest day in John's life. Not even the attempted murder ruined his mood. He did worry about James, but everything turned out okay and he had to admit a little excitement does do the trick for him. Really, those days felt like living in a dream…compared with what followed.There's only so much one can have, right? He thinks bitterly.So he thinks. He thinks of Sherlock ignoring his bursting inbox when helping with the preparation of his wedding. He thinks of the waltz Sherlock composed for him and Mary, and Sherlock's solemn vow, the first and the last vow, before he disappears from the wedding. He thinks of Sherlock's expression after saying jokingly \"now that you've got a real baby on the way\".He doesn't know what Sherlock feels about him, he honestly doesn't. Every time when he thinks he has caught a glimpse of the heart of Sherlock Holmes, every time when something Sherlock says warms his heart, every time when he starts to think there's probably more than friendship between them, what he thinks he's seen always swiftly fades away under a cold mask. Sherlock either appears more distant or changes the subject in a heartbeat.If he's honest with himself, he knows he loves Sherlock. He never likes to admit it, though. He even told Sherlock, in a way, since he's almost certain Sherlock is unlikely to reciprocate (married to his work, hmm?). He never asked. He's not sure if he really wants to know. It will ruin everything if it's been himself all along. Back in Sherlock's two-year absence he realized he couldn't just pine for a man who's not there any more. One can't always want what one will never have. When Sherlock comes back from the dead, he doesn't allow himself to dwell on the thought...now that there's Mary.He's quite good at it, not dwelling on the thought.He did fall in love in Mary. Hasn't been long when he decided to propose to her, but Mary slowly dragged him out of misery. She's clever, witty, doesn't think like everybody else and accepted him for who he is. It was probably in haste but he did believe they would be happy together. He wanted to fill the hole Sherlock left in his life so much. He almost made it, only one step more to a mundane life.And then Sherlock came back.He tried to balance it, oh how he tried, and didn't think it over. Look where it got him.Look where it got Sherlock, where it got them all. If he never met Mary...He rubs at his temples. Stop. He and Mary's anniversary is coming, he should think about that. Right. Think about what they're going to do.John is standing in the water naked, in front of him floats a white ellipsoid. It seems to be hollow within, like a enormous cocoon, big enough to contain a person. He reaches out a hand and the surface splits open under his touch, there's indeed a pupa inside. The pupa cracks open suddenly and exposes a face.Sherlock.Those eyes opens abruptly, like mesmerising coloured flames lighting up, and focus entirely on John. Sherlock opens his mouth as if trying to say something but no sound emerges, and he struggles to break free. Before John can help, Sherlock tears open the remnants of the pupa and sits up.With an unreadable expression, Sherlock looks up at him. The heat in the air between them slowly and quietly climbs up. Sherlock pulls out of the mess, steps into the water and stands before John, nude, his skin so pale almost translucent, faint dark lines mapping his veins. A silence stretches between them.Sherlock closes his eyes and leans down to kiss John, cold hands cupping John's face. John doesn't know when his eyes drops shut as well, compliantly kissing him back in a feverish manner as if it's the most natural thing in the universe, hands trailing down Sherlock's spine, the skin beneath his hand moist with a strange wax-like texture.Sherlock's kisses land at the corner of John's mouth, John's cheek, John's jawline. The water starts coming up, gradually reaching their waists, their sternums, their necks and finally they are completely submerged. Neither of them cares, not when they're under water and completely incapable of stopping. Breathing is entirely irrelevant, breathing is boring.Sherlock straddles John's lap and bends down a little, sucking at John's swollen lips. John wraps a hand around Sherlock's cock and strokes, another hand roaming on Sherlock's back, near his shoulder blades and down the spine to Sherlock's arse, fingers massaging around the hole. Sherlock 's nibs and kisses on John's neck grow erratic. John puts one finger in, and more after a while, Sherlock slowly opening up to him. Soon Sherlock shifts impatiently and moves, grabs John's cocks and leads it in, slowly sitting down. John feels squeezed by the choking wetness, all coherent thoughts shattered to pieces. He clutches Sherlock's hips almost painfully and starts thrusting. Water in between, his rhythm is forced slow in a silent, dreamlike manner, but everything is so very perfect, so fucking perfect -John wakes up all of a sudden, rolls out of bed and stumbles into the bathroom. He releases his frustration, biting his arm to silence himself, burning with shame. This hasn't happened again since he met Mary... until now.And it might not be the last time, he thinks grimly.Afterwards he cleans himself and gets back to bed. Mary is awake, looking at him worriedly, but before she can say anything Wilda starts crying. She hurries to her bed to check on her, later John follows to see if he can help.And then they didn't talk about it.John knows that some people lie without realising they're lying. Some of them might believe what they say is true with all their hearts, or want it to be true, at least, wishing it could become true as soon as the words are spoken. So with the words - the lies - they draw a line to confine themselves and voluntarily put on their own chains.And it takes time to realize how heavy the chains are.He knows. He knows because sometimes he is one of them. He lied when he said he forgave Sherlock, and he lied when he said he forgave Mary. Well, eventually he did forgive Sherlock, but the same isn't true with Mary, not yet.He thinks Mary knows. She's...dodging. Not that she seems to be doing it deliberately, she simply lets their daughter take up every bit of her time, but John can tell. Mary carries on and pretends nothing happened. Neither of them ever brings up her past or Sherlock, as if Sherlock never came back in the first place. But nothing is the same. They eyes meet less and less when talking, the silence after arguments now colder and the goodnight kisses more and more out of duty rather than affection.He can't say he doesn't blame Mary for everything. He probably shouldn't, hell, as if he's not one to blame as well, but he can't help it. Had he not loved Mary he wouldn't have married her at all, however with things like this he's unable to trust her. He realises belatedly that he's always seen traces of another part of Mary. She's intelligent, cautious and persuasive, et cetera, he even likes her for it, but he never saw the ruthlessness beneath all that. She shot Sherlock. No matter how Sherlock tries to take her side, he knows Sherlock flatlined on the table. She almost took Sherlock away from him again.And in a way she did. Sherlock left because of them. Because of her.He thinks Mary knows he blames her. Occasionally he finds her looking at him sadly and turning her gaze away when their eyes meet.John can't help it. Mrs Hudson tells John that someone else is about to move into 221B and Mycroft is going to take away all of Sherlock's belongings. She wonders if he wants to have something.He knows Sherlock took his violin with him. He considers the skull but gives up the idea and took the bull's head instead, placing it on his own living room wall, and hesitates before taking one of Sherlock's scarves. He puts it in the beside table drawer.If Mary finds out, she doesn't let it show.John goes to Prague for a medical conference. On day three he returns to the hotel after all the lectures and dinner. He opens the door and switched the light on.And he finds Sherlock sitting in a chair, looking straight at him. Chapter 3: Consenting to be Wrecked The first thought popping into John's head, funnily enough, is that he's in the wrong room. He takes a deep breath and blinks, makes sure he's not hallucinating, and finds it's not a dream.\"Sherlock,\" John whispers, unable to believe his eyes.\"I understand that you weren't expecting me,\" Sherlock says with a nervous look.For a moment John's lost for words. Sherlock looks him over without a word, and John wonders what he sees.\"Why are you here?\" John finds his voice at last, but regrets immediately for the way it sounds.Sherlock looks down. \"I came here a couple of days ago and, as it happens, you're here as well. I thought I could... well, forget it. Perhaps you don't want to see me. It's about time for me to - \" Sherlock stands up.\"No! No. Don't go. I don't - I mean, it's really...good to see you,\" John goes and sits on the bed, facing Sherlock, \"sit.\"A brief silence. Sherlock sits down, still staring at him with bloodshot eyes. The sleuth is paler and thinner than ever before, his hair slightly shorter and his clothing an utterly different style, even his entire posture has seemingly altered. But John still feels blessed, somehow.John wasn't lying just now, he is happy... but also completely at a loss.\"I named her Wilda,\" John says.\"Oh, did you,\" Sherlock paused, \"she must be beautiful.\"\"She's perfect.\"\"How's Mary?\"\"Good. She's...good.\"\"You didn't update your blog.\"\"I...don't plan to write again.\"\"Oh.\"And silence again.\"221B's rented out.\"\"Heard about it.\"John hesitates a little before asking, \"so how are you doing these days?\"Sherlock bites his lower lip. \"Apparently I'm still alive here.\"\"Why...why did you come to me?\" Needing help? Having to ask something in person (John's heart skips a beat)? He can't have come all this way to talk about the good old days.\"I...\" Sherlock looks hesitant. \"I meant to... to ask something of you.\"Nothing new. \"What is it?\" John asks quietly.Sherlock stands up again, visibly trying to escape the room. \"Nothing. Nothing, just...forget it. Bit not good. I'd better - \" but John follows and catches his wrist. Sherlock turns abruptly towards John, a shudder in his body, but he doesn't pull away. He just freezes and looks down at John's face, eyes roaming frantically as if searching for something, desperate like a wild bird in a cage.And John knows.He suddenly knows. He knows for sure now.He knows that every word in Sherlock's best man speech was real, he knows why Sherlock took such a reckless step and shot Magnussen, he knows what Sherlock intended to say on the fucking tarmac. The idiot probably never got over himself.Neither did John.God. And he made Sherlock his best man, if only, if only he had known...John doesn't let go, and moves closer instead, noting a hitch in Sherlock's breath. Right now they're barely an inch apart.\"What is it, Sherlock?\" John asks, voice almost a whisper.Sherlock lets out a shaky breath and kisses him.The touch of their lips becomes instantly dazzling. Intoxicating. John kisses back without thinking, and Sherlock opens his lips under John's with a whimper, his hands grabbing John's shoulders. John's hand goes up to the nape of Sherlock's neck, wanting him to be closer. Eventually Sherlock breaks the wet ardent kiss, trying to catch his breath, forehead leaning against John's.John is breathless.\"Oh God, I probably - \"\"Don't say you shouldn't have,\" Sherlock backs away abruptly, interrupting him.\"Right,\" John answers and doesn't move, starting to feel shamefaced. This is betrayal. He's now unfaithful to his family. He has...No. Stop. Not now, not when he has what he doesn't even dare dream of having before him in a silver platter. It can wait. Everything else can bloody wait. \"I'm not even sure it really happened...what is it that you want? This?\"\"No. No. Not just this. I mean...\" Sherlock inhales deeply, shakes his head in exasperation and closes his eyes, \"I wanted to...to see your scar.\"John blinks, and then frowns.\"Why?\"A short silence. \"This is...the only thing that I can't fully imagine,\" Sherlock swallows, \"I keep a file on you, in my head. I was able to gather or deduce all the other information, everything save for your scar. Didn't occur to me until I... left. It's sheer luck that we're in the same city and I'm not followed. I'm very unlikely to see you again, I can't even get in touch. What I'm doing, I don't want to get you... involved.\"\"So. Whatever you're doing, it's dangerous, isn't it?\" John can literally feel his own anger rising. Is this what you meant to get yourself in?Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. \"It doesn't matter.\"\"Of course it fucking matters! If you don't care what happens to yourself, I do. I happen to care and I can't know you can be possibly dying thousands of miles away and just pretend to be okay with it - \"\"I know what I'm doing,\" Sherlock interrupts, eyebrows suddenly locked in a frown. He pauses, and assures John, \"I promise, once this is over there will be nothing to worry about. Maybe I'll need to hide, but it won't be dangerous.\"\"You'd better mean it,\" John looks at him, unconvinced, \"I'll bloody well make you pay if you lie to me.\"Sherlock raises an eyebrow. \"Of course. Now back to the point, please.\"There's something...off, though he can't tell what. He lets it go and starts to think about Sherlock's request. There's never quite anything 'normal' when he's with Sherlock. John isn't ashamed of his scar, but it doesn't make him proud, either. He doesn't know what might happen, exposing himself under the detective's scrutiny, what Sherlock would see. Some, namely those women who once shared a bed with him, always made him uncomfortable when they stared at his scar. It's like there's something frightening instead of the mark that a bullet left (Not that Sherlock would be like this, no, never). Mary was an exception, and it's almost laughable, now that he knows what she used to be. Or rather, what she is.He feels a stab of hidden anger. It's probably just lurking under the surface all this time, however deep he tries to bury it. John rubs his temple a little, as if he could drive Mary out of his mind. He sighs and makes the decision.Hopefully the right one, but he doesn't care anyway.\"Fine, if you insist,\" John says. \"But there's something I want you to do in return.\"\"Do what?\" Sherlock sounds mildly surprised.John starts to doubt if he's a masochist after all. \"Show me yours.\"Panic flashes across Sherlock's face. \"No.\"\"It's fair.\"\"It's not a game,\" Sherlock swallows hard.\"Didn't mean to make it sound like one.\"\"I... no.\"\"It's not like there's anything I haven't seen already. I, well, I know there are scars. On your back.\" He saw a little when Sherlock was in hospital, and he never asked back then, didn't even occur to him again after all hell broke loose. He had too much to think about.\"But - \"\"Or just forget it.\"Sherlock seems to be hesitating. After a moment he nods. John's hand moves to the front of his shirt. \"Together?\"As John takes off the t-shirt inside, Sherlock quietly shrugs out of his jacket and slowly unbuttons his shirt. The removal of the fabric reveals a newly stitched wound in his abdomen. No dressing.\"Sherlock!\" John exclaims, \"You bloody liar, you just said it wasn't - \"\"John. Don't. Just...don't.\" The exhaustion in his voice takes all the words away from John. John gets down on his knees, eyes level with the wound, and starts inspecting it.\"No infection yet. Have you taken antibiotics? \"\"Yes.\"\"Seems like it's going to scar,\" John's voice is tense.Probably won't get to, Sherlock thinks and takes off his shirt properly absent-mindedly, staring into nowhere.Sherlock is thinking. His mouth slipped and here come the consequences, he has to think of a way to make up for this. John just said something to him, something about the scar Mary's bullet left, and he answers at random. He shouldn't have come here. He shouldn't have come in the first place, but he couldn't resist the temptation of seeing John again. John mustn't know he's going to die at a certain point. He has gone beyond Mycroft's expectation, but he hasn't the faintest idea how much longer he's going to last.Someone's touching his back and he almost flinches in surprise - but oh. It can only be John. He can feel John's finger moving in a certain trail, tracing one of his scars. \"When?\" John's choked voice sounds from behind.\"Mostly in Serbia, before I came back. I was captured. Tried to escape but didn't succeed. Mycroft got me out and then I was back.\"\"So when you showed up at the restaurant...you still have these?\"Sherlock can't just say yes and some of them cracked open a bit, so he doesn't answer.\"Jesus! The things I did...I was a fucking - I tackled you, for God's sake!...\"\"Don't. Stop. They were mostly healed at the time.\" In hindsight he deserves it perhaps, for his stupidity and negligence.John says nothing. When he stands in front of Sherlock once again, he has calmed down a little. John looks up at him and forces a smile. \"Sorry. I remember you're the one who asked first.\" So Sherlock comes back to himself.Take me, he meant to say at the time. It would be his first time, hopefully the last time as well. He doesn't care if it hurts, wants it to hurt, even. He wants it to hurt for a while. It would no doubt affect his work, but it should remind him of John. He would wait in a morbid fascination for the last bit of trace John leaves on him to fade, little by little, just as he will sure fade from John's life.But that was rather the point, fading from John's life, so he changed his mind the last second, knowing it's no longer about what he wants the most. What he said instead is true as well, that he keeps a file on John in his mind palace, that he craves for the information on John's scar. It's just that there's much, much more he craves, things that he will never get a chance to know.His hand has reached out towards John's scar before he knows it, and before he could take it away, John's hand catches his own, placing it right on the scar, on the patch of skin and tissues.So Sherlock hesitantly starts to touch. He memorises the shape, the texture, moves around John to see the place where the bullet exited John's body and did the same. When he puts down his hand, John turns around to face him and looks him straight in the eye, a hand reaching up to touch the nape of Sherlock's neck.On a whim Sherlock kisses John again, and deepens the kiss when John's lips open to him. He can feel John's hesitation when he kisses back. Then the kiss draws to a stop for their need of air. Take me. Let me be yours, if only for a while. Only when John freezes does Sherlock realise he has said it aloud.Stupid. Stupid. So he has to mess it up. There's Mary, there's Wilda, there's Sherlock's imminent fucking death. He waits for John's gentle but firm refusal.But John simply looks at him, cupping Sherlock's face silently. In the end John kisses him and takes him to bed. I love you. John cleaned them both up afterwards. They cling to each other under the covers, with Sherlock burying his face in John's neck and breathing deeply. Sherlock is warmer than John thinks.\"Did I hurt you?\"\"No,\" Sherlock answers, his voice somewhat muffled.\"Okay. Are you...smelling me?\"\"Filing.\" Sherlock mutters. John lets out a chuckle, and for a while they don't say anything.Then Sherlock shifts a bit and sighs. \"I have to leave tomorrow morning.\"John listens, making a noncommital \"hmm\". He feels something tighten in his chest, but knows this is inevitable. I love you. He doesn't say it. It's too late to regret the choices that he made now, there's nothing he can change. Sherlock is leaving and he's going back to the life he's leading now. No need to make it harder than it has to be.This is a goodbye to five years of hopeless dreams. Only for the night. He is cheating on Mary but he refuses to face his own guilt. There's plenty of time for that, but not now. Not when he's going to lose Sherlock again.After the long silence, Sherlock suddenly starts, \"I can write to you, perhaps,\" and adds after a brief stop, \"but no promises.\"\"Okay,\" John answers, trying to keep the sadness out of his tone. He turns Sherlock around, wraps his arms around his waist from behind and plants a soft kiss on Sherlock's shoulder. I love you. Sherlock's hand covers one of his and leads it upwards, stopping at Sherlock's chest.He doesn't know when he falls asleep. When he wakes up, Sherlock's gone, the bed beside him already cold. He found a note in the pocket of his coat that afternoon.\"The file on you is complete,\" Sherlock's messy scrawl reads.John folds the paper carefully and puts it in his wallet. He feels completely hollowed out. Chapter 4: Slipping into the Masterpiece John considers whether he should tell Mary and decides against it. It can only be between him and Sherlock.He doesn't admit it, but deep down there's a part of him thinking that Mary doesn't deserve to know.Roughly two months after he came back from Prague, John is woke by a text at two am. For a moment he almost thinks that it is Sherlock, and that John himself is still at 221B.A look at his phone tells him it's from an unfamiliar number. I love you, don't forget me, it says.He frowns, and suddenly there's another text. Sorry, wrong number. Sure enough. He puts the phone back, but doesn't fall asleep again that night.Just when John starts to think Sherlock forgot his own promise, he receives an email on January 29 the following year. An unfamiliar address, no salutation, no signature, however he knows it's from Sherlock the instant he clicks it open. He simply knows. It's astonishingly sentimental of him, choosing such a date, although given their...situation, John thinks, it's not strange, not really.Subject: Nothing Out of Ordinary So I'm writing, just like I said. Don't reply. Took an effort to prevent others tracking this, if you write back I probably won't get it anyway. I'm doing fine. The wound did scar. Had a bullet graze two weeks ago, but nothing else out of ordinary. The work is almost done save for some loose ends. Probably just going to take a month or two. Afterwards I'll have to wait for the fuss to die down and somehow find a way to stop myself going mad with boredom. Maybe I'll read something about the solar system, terrible literature and all the useless things people waste their time on. Then I'll find somewhere to go. Can't find decent tea anywhere in this bloody place. Sometimes I miss the tea you made. There's only so much time I can spare, I have things to do. I'll write again. It's disappointingly brief, but relieving somehow. It makes John worry less, at least.John feels Mary is growing more and more distant. It's like they're merely living in the same house taking care of the same child. Frankly, he isn't surprised. Simply sad. He feels a little guilty, for he knows he's gradually closing up to her. He can't help it.He thinks of a divorce, sometimes, but he tries to suppress the thought. Maybe there's still hope, they just need a good talk and slowly sort it out.They never talk about it, though.John receives the second email in August this year. The same address, still no salutation or signature.Subject: Settled Down (Sort of) Mission accomplished. I found a place to stay, maybe will stay for long. I can't tell you where. They may assign similar tasks to me, I can't risk being discovered. Thus, regrettably, you still can't write back. Don't know what Wilda is like. Wish I could see her. I don't do this, this writing thing. I don't know what to write at all. There's nothing worth writing down so far, I'm nearly bored to death. You will force me to watch crap telly if you were here. I tried, doesn't work. For goodness' sake, everything's so painfully dull. Can't function properly. Maybe I should try to find a case somehow. Hope you're doing fine. I'll write again.It was an accident. It was dark, and it was too late when the driver saw Mary. Wilda lost her Mum. The funeral is small and there aren't many people here. Wilda sleeps through it in John's arms.Once recovered from the shock and loss several months later, John feels a numb regret.There's so much, so much he should have said and done. Now there's only a cold gravestone left.It's most probably his own fault. Why else does he end up like this every time?He doesn't have much time to mourn. Wilda needs him. There's work. He moves to a smaller flat and Wilda stops asking for her Mum in a month. John puts a bunch of flowers at Mary's grave every month.He doesn't know whether he's somewhat experienced from Sherlock's \"death\", or he's really not that sad. With his little girl to tend to, he hardly has time to think about it.Subject: Bored Hope everything's all right with you. I still talk to you sometimes. It's stupid, you're not really here. Sometimes I can't remember that. Find myself writing a hell lot of useless things and then deleting them. You know, I took Molly on a case when I came back, just once. I could hear you babbling in my head at the crime scene that day. I still do, sometimes. You in my head always tell me to eat or sleep. Don't know how much has changed in 221B. Of course it doesn't matter to me anyhow. I keep it in my mind palace, exactly how it was before I left. I've stolen two of your jumpers, one hidden in the bedroom. The new tenants are unlikely to find it. I know Mycroft's taken all of my things away, but he didn't find it for sure. I wonder what you've taken. My possessions should have been freely at your disposal, you know. If you'd take anything, it must be the bull's head, though on my part I wish you'd take the scull.John doesn't think he's all right, but he'll live. Sherlock doesn't seem to know about Mary's death. But John has long deserted his blog anyway, and Mycroft probably won't condescend to tell Sherlock the news (or they haven't been in touch?), and it's not impossible that Sherlock knows but deliberately avoids talking about it. Yeah. Sherlock's not good at this kind of thing. John sighs, shuts the laptop and starts making a shopping list, watching Wilda playing quietly from the corner of his eyes.He absent-mindedly lists what they've run out of, meanwhile telling himself not to dwell on the exact locations of his stolen jumpers.Sherlock sends John email roughly twice a year, no pattern in the time signature. Sometimes he talks about cases, so the mail becomes a bit longer. John gets slightly nostalgic. Those days going on cases with Sherlock seem entirely another life. He misses the adrenaline brought by danger, the fluttering hem of Sherlock's coat in his stride and the midnight violin. At first the longing would make him curl up at night, but he learns to adjust himself to the mundane life. He has his own life now, he has his Wilda.Gradually, John stops deliberately checking his inbox. There's still a small delight receiving Sherlock's email. It lets him know Sherlock's also continuing his own life somewhere in the world, just like John. There are probably thousands of miles between, but a simple email is nearly enough. It's a small comfort.Given that Sherlock's email never stopped, it's probably the same to him, isn't it?Sometimes, just sometimes, John dreams of the night in Prague, the first and the last.In those dreams, with his lips pressed against Sherlock's soft skin, he's always murmuring tender words, as if every bit of his yearning and adoration will be etched into Sherlock's skin and seep in his veins. He whispers sweet nothings and tells Sherlock he loves him, over and over and over.And then he wakes up. Now he can write it down, he can speak it out loud all he likes and Sherlock will never know.John knows there's no point in regret, but he should have told Sherlock. He should have told Sherlock.Occasionally he and Greg go out for a pint. Occasionally he visits Mrs Hudson. They meet less and less, now that the crazy brilliant man connecting them is gone.John goes on his first date in a long time one year after Wilda starts going to nursery. Her name is Rosalind and she's younger than him. They met in a Tesco, Wilda was pointing at the woman's dress at the time, exclaiming happily that she liked the colour. So the woman started chatting with him, and it seemed John hadn't forgotten how to flirt after all. Rosalind left him her number.He thought it over and called her two days later. After that there were a couple of dates. This time he walks her home and she invites him in for coffee.And John accepts.Rosalind is in the kitchen, and John looks around her sitting room, scanning the back of the books on her shelves and suddenly finds a scull on the upper shelf.Probably finding him staring at it, Rosalind comes up to him from behind. \"Well?\"John points at the scull and asks before he can think, \" friend of yours?\"\"Oh, that!\" The woman laughs. \"My friends had a costume party here last week. I borrowed it, haven't given it back. I always forget, though how I manage to put up with such a spooky thing I don't know. Looks familiar?\" She jokes.John forces a laugh, suddenly wanting to escape. He gives an excuse to leave and watches Rosalind's face fall.He doesn't contact the woman again. Nor does he go on another date. Ever.John buys another wallet.He keeps Sherlock's note. After a moment's hesitation, he puts it in and hides it under Wilda's photograph.To John's surprise, Wilda likes detective stories more than anything. He tells her about some of the cases he and Sherlock investigated together, and his little girl claps her hand wanting more.Initially he's happy to tell the stories again (after taking out some inappropriate contents, of course), but finds fewer and fewer untold ones left. He find it almost difficult to remember Sherlock's rapture when he had discoveries, Sherlock's tone when he was firing out a series of deductions and the way Sherlock's eyes shone as the mystery unfolded.Finding these memories going faint seizes him with terror. They're still there, though, hidden and worn, but not yet gone. He nearly sighs with relief.Now, perhaps, he can bring himself to admit he's glad he hasn't forgotten what fascinates him the most about Sherlock.When he receives Sherlock's email again, he notices that Sherlock's using a tone as if he were still at 221B looking for ways to pass the time and John were simply somewhere else on a business trip. His friend still has an excellent memory John's envious of. His \"files\".To think Sherlock once pretended John was with him while he was not...John dismisses the thought. Sherlock can't still be doing that after all this time. But if he could write back, he would ask, in a playful way. Perhaps Sherlock would say yes. Perhaps. Who knows.One day he's checking his inbox, not expecting Sherlock's email, for it's only two months since the last one.But there are emails from Sherlock. Seventeen of them, all at once. John checks the time stamp and finds they were all sent at the same time.It's suddenly a lot harder to breathe.There must be something wrong. There must be. John can think of nothing but ask Mycroft. He manages to find Mycroft's number, but...John knows it's too old. It's been more than six years, after all. He doesn't know if he can reach him at all.For some time no one answers. John grits his teeth, waits and tries again.And finally someone picked up.\"John.\" John recognises Mycroft's voice, sounding mildly surprised.Well, at least he doesn't have to go all the way to Diogenes club. He wants to directly ask about Sherlock but holds back, reminded of the lengths Sherlock went to in order to keep his survival a secret. \"We need to talk,\" John says at last.There's a silence on the other end, and finally Mycroft speaks, \"I'll be in touch,\" and hangs up.John wants to scream, when he calls again no one answers. Mycroft had better keep his fucking word.He sends Wilda to her friend's for the night the other afternoon, walking on the street thinking of Sherlock, distracted and vexed. A black car pulls up next to him. He gets in and sits next to Mycroft, who seems to have aged a lot.\"To what do I owe the pleasure of this little appointment?\" Mycroft drawls coldly.\"I need to...it's about Sherlock.\"Mycroft remains expressionless. \"What about Sherlock?\"\"He...he writes to me. He sends me emails, all this time, about twice a year. I'm sure it's him. But yesterday he...there was seventeen emails all sent at the same time. It's only two months since his last one...there has to be something wrong. You need to tell me.\"Mycroft simply looks at him, deadpan, and says nothing.\"Mycroft? We should find out what's going on at least, do something - \"\"Sherlock is dead,\" Mycroft cuts in.An awful silence falls.\"Wha...what?\"\"Sherlock is dead.\" Mycroft closes his eyes, suddenly appearing exhausted.\"This...this had better not be some tricks you're playing - \"\"I believe he went to see you in Prague.\"\"...Yes.\"\"He died two months after that.\" Chapter 5: We Gather Up Our Hearts and Go Sherlock knows his cover is blown. He has just finished destroying all the data in the computer. Now it's only a matter of time. He goes out and buys a burner phone, entering a number he's all too familiar with before sending a text.He regrets it as soon as he hits the send button, so he adds another text before disposing of the phone. Sorry, wrong number. And he waits, swaying between praying those people coming will show mercy on him by killing him instantly and doing it himself.\"It's impossible,\" John says dumbly.\"I identified the body. It was him.\" Mycroft starts rubbing at his own temples. \"He didn't want you to know.\"\"He said - \" John shakes his head.\"I checked those emails he sent you and looked into the account he had acquired. I believe he had written all of those before he died and made it possible to send them to you automatically. The report shows that there's been a glitch in the system recently, which is why you received the rest of them yesterday.\"\"Oh God...\"\"He was going on a suicide mission. Honestly speaking, I hadn't expected that he could last for such a long time.\"\"What?\" Mycroft's flat tone makes John burn with fury. \"Did you even hear what you said? You just...let him?\"\"There is...a limit to my powers,\" Mycroft answers quietly, hanging his head.\"You're the most fucking powerful human being in Britain! What kind of man will let his brother - \"\"Do you think I had a choice?\" Mycroft snaps all of a sudden, interrupting him. \"I had warned him not to get involved in this mess and he never listened! Had he not gone out of his mind and did something so stupid for you and your assassin wife, it wouldn't have come to this. He kept the woman safe on your behalf, who was utterly unworthy of his effort - \"\"You have no right to say this!\" John hisses.\" - and threw his life away during the process! He took no heed of the consequences and overestimated his strength. My hands were tied,\" Mycroft carries on regardless, his voice begins to waver. \"I have powers, but they are restricted after all. They had wanted to assign to him the mission from the start, I was able to stop it happening before Sherlock killed Magnussen on the spot. I tried to tell him but he didn't understand. There's nothing I could do. I've been lying to our parents. He abandoned everything, but didn't want you to know. He even asked me not to tell you.\"John opens his mouth, but nothing came out.\"He just went on with it. He could have got out of it, actually, he could have faked his death again and fooled everyone. Maybe returning to England would have been too risky, but he could have gone somewhere else, solving cases for his own pleasure and keeping bees. I suppose he didn't want to, in a manner of speaking.\" Mycroft's voice lowers. He shakes his head with a wry smile, seemingly tired from the outburst. \"The number you dialed, John, it's always been kept for him. After five years the phone rang, you can imagine my surprise.\"I believe I've said enough.\" Mycroft's slightly shaking hand covers his eyes. \"I failed to fulfil my primary responsibility, Dr Watson, and I don't need you to remind me of that.\" Why? John paces in his empty sitting room, tearing at his hair.Sherlock. Sherlock. SHERLOCK. Dead. Gone. Who does he think he is? So the idiot thinks - thought - he was so clever, didn't he, thought he had foreseen it all, always one step ahead of eveyone. Did he believe so firmly there wouldn't be any possibility between them, thus didn't even care whether John would reciprocate? Would he rather stay in the emotional toil and torture himself silently for John than risk giving out his heart and come out of his shell? Why did he...how could he? The bastard thought keeping John in the dark would make everything all right, didn't he? All his lies, drowning John in the bittersweet illusions, denying John even the basic right to mourn him. It could have been different. It didn't have to come to this. It didn't have to be like this.But Sherlock did try, didn't he? He came to John after all. God. What if Sherlock hadn't realized John...felt the same for him? He must have thought John was pitying him...John knows the accusations are unfair even as he's thinking. He knows. Isn't he a coward himself? Wasn't he the same when he concealed his thoughts? It's me. It's my fault. I should have told him. It could have been different. It didn't have to come to this. It didn't have to be like this, even though there would be ups and downs in between.God, what has he done? How can he shrug off the responsibility and blame it on Sherlock alone? Sherlock, who had the brain of a genius but couldn't work out the fact that he was John's best friend, who learned how to fold sodding napkins for his wedding on Youtube, who composed a waltz for he and Mary's first dance?And John left all those words unspoken. All of them.John falls down on his knees, long absent tears scalding his eyes.He picks Wilda up in the afternoon the next day, takes her shopping, goes home with her and cooks her a meal. He doesn't know how he manages to do it all without dropping dead. He falls asleep on the sofa for a bit when she's playing.\"Daddy, are you all right?\"\"Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine. I'm just...tired.\"After putting Wilda to bed, he sinks into the sofa and stares unseeingly into the void.A month later he goes shopping on his own and walks to Baker Street on impulse, looking at the familiar front door of 221B across the street. He hasn't been here for a while, but his dreams never quite leaves the place. John feels like he's saying goodbye, to the science equipment scattered on the table, the body parts in the fridge, Bond flims marathorns and black cars that frequently pulls up at the door.Although he's already lost those for longer than he knows.He crosses the street and walks up to the door, intending to knock and go in to have a look, but changes his mind. He simply leaves the knocker crooked and goes away without ever turning around.He doesn't dare think about what could have been, if he had gathered up the courage a long, long time ago and told Sherlock.Maybe there would be a Sherlock and a John, staying at 221B Baker Street forever and ever. Together.After loads of sleepless nights, he thinks about Mycroft saying he kept the old number for Sherlock. For five years, he would have to mind some little things, charging the phone, for instance. Maybe he has someone do it for him.Sentiment, Sherlock would have said.John shuts his eyes tight. I love you. Oddly enough, Sherlock's grave is still there, untouched. John doesn't know what he's thinking, he just goes there on a whim. He has no idea where Sherlock's buried, maybe here, maybe somewhere else. He can't bring himeself to ask. I love you. He stares at the gold engravings on the black marble. Sherlock Holmes.\"I love you,\" John whispers.He can't pray for a miracle this time, the maker of the miracles can't hear him any more. All that's left of the brilliant man he loved is a body lying cold in the ground.After half a year, John steels himself and reads the seventeen emails, word for word, and then finds all the previous ones.He knows it now, why Sherlock asked him not to reply, why Sherlock always talked about ambiguous things. What was Sherlock thinking when he's writing John these and painstakingly making things up?He wouldn't know, would he, he thinks sadly. He would never know.John buys another wallet.He opens Sherlock's note. The paper is yellowing. His fingers traces the black handwriting : The file on you is complete.He folds it up and puts it in, next to Wilda's photograph and never reads it again.The file's already been closed.Life goes on. He goes to the surgery, he takes care of Wilda, he cleans the room, he turns the telly on mute at midnight.John knows, slowly, gradually, the hollow pain in his chest is going to ease little by little. One day he's going to think of Sherlock without pain or regret - and maybe one day, John will even think of him with a smile. It doesn't feel right, and in some sense he doesn't really want to recover. It's just that he eventually will. It's inevitable.But today is not the day.He waits for it to come with fear and hope. He doesn't know what Sherlock wanted for him. This is, under the circumstances, probably the best outcome he - they - can have now.John's gun is in the drawer of his beside table, right on top of Sherlock's old scarf.It's been long, far too long since it is last used. It was taken away for a while after Sherlock shot Magnussen, but Sherlock got it back for him before he left. John likes to put it where he can get it easily, though he hardly has any use for it any more.(Four years later)\"Dad, what is this?\"John turns and finds Wilda holding a dust-covered album. God knows where she found it, she likes raking over old things these days. She opens it, and John moves closer to look.It's the album with his wedding photos, and he tells Wilda. John remembers the camera was taken as evidence because of the photographer, though Sherlock insisted there wouldn't be anything useful in the photos. It was quite some trouble getting the photos.Wilda quietly looks at Mary in the photo.They rifle through the photos. John sees Sherlock in some of them and points him out, it cheers Wilda up a bit.\"You know, Dad, sometimes I thought you probably made him up for my bedtime stories. You said he's your friend, but I never met him.\" Wilda studies the photos closely. \"There really is a Sherlock.\"\"Of course there is! How else would I have known Greg? When did I ever lie to you?\" John feigns a hurt expression.\"When you say I can have more chocolate!\" Wilda giggles, and John can't help but laugh along.\"Of course he's real,\" John says when laughter subsides. \"I probably haven't told you we named you after him.\"\"Then shouldn't I be Sherlock Watson?\" Wilda frowns.John opens his mouth to explain but goes still. Sherlock Watson. Sherlock's voice rings distantly in his head. I think it could work.Everything, everything they could have had but never got to reach for suddenly flashes through John's mind. Thousands of possibilities, all that remains the same is the only consulting detective in the world and his blogger. Everything that could have been, forever lost. No one knows how they became the way they are now.Or, no one knows more than him how they became the way they are now.A sad smile spreads across John's lips. Oh, Sherlock. You bastard. Wherever you are, cheers. -The End- Underneath Your Ruins This is my alibi - underneath your ruins I'm buried. Diary of Dreams, Mind over Matter John opened his eyes sleepily and found that it’s still dark outside. He shook his head and sank back into his pillow, closing his eyes again. Sherlock was really busy with the new case, there's no telling whether he would drag John on an investigation on a whim. He needed all the sleep he could get. He fell back to sleep. Wilda was ten the first time she was told that Sherlock Holmes was dead.That day she discovered her parents' wedding photos. Her dad told her about the wedding, and, of course, his best man Sherlock Holmes, her hero in all those bedtime stories when she was younger. Oh, to think there's an attempted murder at his father's wedding. After that Wilda asked John why Sherlock'd never shown up in their life if they're such good friends.There was a brief silence, not unlike the one before John explained to her that Sherlock's first name was actually William. And then John told her Sherlock was dead.She was surprised, sad beyond words. Dad talked about him all the time and she didn't know...she had always been obsessed with this mysterious detective in all John's stories, trying to make deductions all the time (which turn out to be spectacular failures half the time) though she doubted if he was real at times. She even made John allow her to learn how to play the violin after knowing that Sherlock played the violin (later she found it wasn't much fun but didn't give up anyway). She asked why, she asked how, and John just shook his head and changed the subject.There was an envelope in the album, addressed to Dr and Mrs Watson. Music sheets inside. John said it was the waltz Sherlock composed for him and her mom. Wilda opened it and read, trying not to hum the tune. Afterwards she took it when John wasn't watching and tucked it in a thick book, saving it for later practice.She couldn't quite bring herself to actually play it for years, though. John was wandering in a Tesco. He forgot to take his shopping list and couldn't remember what he intended to buy. Milk. Must have been milk. Sherlock, the lazy bastard, couldn't be arsed to remember this sort of stuff. He offered to buy milk sometimes to stop John complaining but never did it. John even doubted if Sherlock knew where Tesco is. Hopefully the fridge wouldn't stink with Sherlock's new experiment. Wilda was fourteen the first time she was told that her dad used to have a blog.That day dad was at school to pick her up. The mother of a new boy here suddenly started chatting John up.\"Excuse me, have I seen you somewhere before? Mr...\"\"Watson. John Watson. I'm a doctor.\"\"...oh! Oh dear! You're the friend of that detective, right? Sherlock Holmes? What a surprise! I was a fan of your blog back then, Dr Watson. You stopped updating ages ago. Pity, that. What happened? I think--\"John looked extremely uncomfortable, made an excuse and left with Wilda in a hurry. \"You had a blog?\" Wilda asked on their way home.\"It was a long time ago,\" John sighs and didn't say anything after that. You had fans? Really? Wilda wanted to say but stopped herself. When she got home she searched it on the Internet and finished reading the contents in three days, using her spare time. She recognised some stories she had heard, briefer versions, but also containing things John didn't tell her.She read Sherlock's comments and found Sherlock's old website. This was the first time she had found something about the detective outside of John's descriptions. It felt strange. Of course, she didn't tell John. Tea. John stretched, rubbed at his eyes and put the kettle on. He made two, naturally, in the way they like. Sherlock was quiet, probably sleeping, then maybe he shouldn't have made the tea for him. But he could be hiding in his room, up to no good. Maybe he'd come out wearing nothing but a sheet. And John would laugh at him, but John liked it when Sherlock wore nothing but a sheet. Not that John would ever admit it. Wilda was twenty-three the first time she heard the full story, or so she thought.That day she went to her dad's for a visit and stays the night. It didn't feel right, seeing him all alone like that. It wasn't difficult to get over her mother - she barely knew her after all - and so she suggested, \"You should find someone, you know. You never did, though, never seen you going on a date even once. Don't know why.\"John laughed. \"Charming as I am, it's hardly the time for it now. There's no need for that. I can manage perfectly.\"\"I mean it. It's never too late.\"\"So do I. Not necessary.\"\"Wouldn't you feel...lonely?\"\"Says the one who dumped me in the first place,\" John joked. \"Don't worry, dear. I'm used to it.\"That night, however, when they were sitting on the sofa not-really-watching telly, dad told her the full story (or so she thought). How he met Sherlock, days back in Baker Street, cases, Moriarty, the three years when Sherlock was away, Wilda's mother, Sherlock coming back, the wedding, and...the end. Sherlock went to eastern Europe and never came back, John didn't know he was dead until several years later.Though a little hard to believe, Wilda knew there was no need for John to lie. She didn't know what to think about Mary. Neither did she know what to think about the length Sherlock went to so as to keep them safe.After a while they said goodnight, as if nothing happened. They were both pretty good at that, pretending nothing happened. John still mentioned Sherlock from time to time.In hindsight, Wilda should have thought about it, what made John want to tell her all this.Once in a while, there were questions, all these years, when people realised who her father was. Whether they had been together. She had wondered as well, finding herself not against the idea. She had seen those conversations like old married couples' on the blog and the forum herself, after all. But not likely. Dad got married and had her--who could be that stupid, willing to be the best man of the one he loved?But she wasn't so sure, now. Shopping bags in hand, John walked to the door to 221B, wondering why he had chosen a Tesco so far away. He found the knocker straight and crooked it a bit. He fumbled with his keys - and found he couldn't open the door with any of them. He realised something was wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong. Wilda was twenty-seven when John was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.The tenants of 221B nowadays found John at the doorstep, who was confused in the extreme. The doctors said it was only a matter of time before it got worse. She blamed herself for not finding it out sooner, though she probably wouldn't have, having mistaken the mood swings and forgetfulness for old age. All these symptoms she had overlooked, and John himself...he probably didn't realise it. After he knew the diagnosis he buried his face in his hands, not saying a word.She moved in with him and hired help. She made a thorough search around the flat, getting rid of dangerous things. She couldn't find the gun anywhere, though. It wasn't where she remembered it had been, in the drawer. After a month of trying she could only assume John disposed of it at some point. Probably a long time ago. She asked, when John was conscious, and he said he had forgotten it.John forgot more and more. He became grumpy, quite so, emotional like a child, frequently throwing fits for the tiniest things. He mixed things up, time and memories, and sometimes he didn't even recognise Wilda, just asking for his little girl when she was right in front of him. And sometimes he was so convinced he should be somewhere else. Kent, Afghanistan, London, or Baker Street. Baker Street. Baker Street. Sherlock. Where is Sherlock? Is he at the Yard? I texted him and he didn't text back. No one else will make him remember to eat.It was worse for Wilda when John occasionally added a chuckle.She told him the truth the first time, a mistake she didn't wish to repeat a second time. She didn't want to explain things again and again just to watch his confused face fell into shock and horror. He's out. At Bart's, probably. He went to buy some stuff, something like that. Must be busy.Sometimes Wilda almost wanted to slam the door and lock herself in a room, just so she could freely tear at her hair and scream. It was nigh unbearable, watching her father like this. It hurt. It hurt so much. She never thought she needed to cherish those casual, normal days they had together, before. And finally she did, now that they occurred less and less, now that it was almost too late.She managed to rent 221B. Mrs Hudson passed away a long time ago. The current owner was some relative of hers. Took her a week convincing him and the tenants. Then she started to contact people. Greg, Molly, even Philip Anderson, so she could figure out what the old flat was like.That was when Mycroft Holmes called her, the coldness in his voice politely masked. She felt quite uneasy stomaching the idea of meeting him. There were many reasons she tried to avoid him, though she knew he kept all the things Sherlock had had. It would be extremely awkward. How could one face his own brother's death without a trace of discomfort?But she went anyway. She went to the place (an empty house) and met an old man. Despite his age, the sharpness of his gaze was rather unnerving. The feeling of being looked through was unpleasant enough as it is. Would it be the same, if it were Sherlock Holmes looking at her?\"I believe we can skip the introductions.\" Mycroft drawled.\"Certainly.\"\"Then I'll come straight to the point. You rented 221B and plans to move in, along with your father.\"\"Yes,\" she hesitated before saying. \"I want the flat to be like before, back when he lived there. My father...I think you know. I just want to do what I can.\" Considering he talked about the three am violin more than he talked about her mother.Mycroft raised an eyebrow. \"So you knew.\"Wilda knew what he was referring to, or at least she thought she did. She nodded.Mycroft smiled, though Wilda could tell he wasn't glad in the slightest. \"Very well. The thing is, Miss Watson, I'm keeping my brother's belongings as well as old footage. I can give them to you.\"Footage, oh really? Shoving away the thought, she could sense some unspoken demand, but Mycroft didn't go on.\"In exchange of what?\" She asked.\"You do take after your father a lot.\" The man said, somewhat amused.Wilda defiantly raised her chin a bit, expecting a challenge. \"Of which I'm glad.\"\"Sherlock would have liked you. Pity he found himself an excuse to flee from this, once and for all,\" Mycroft shaked his head with a wry smile. Flee from what?She didn't ask. She knew.\"You play the violin, Miss Watson.\"\"A bit out of practice,\" because of her dad, \"but yes.\"\"When Sherlock left, he took his violin with him, which is now in my keeping,\" Mycroft looked downwards. \"I can have all the other things sent to you. This item, however, is not one I can easily give up. I have my terms.\"Her heart skipped a beat. As much as Wilda hated situations like this, the violin is, in some sense, the sole reason for which she learned to play the violin.\"I want you to play for me, Miss Watson. Whichever piece to your liking, and then it will be yours.\"A sadness struck her then and there, and she suddenly felt so sorry for this man she'd never met before. She agreed. Of course she agreed.The day they moved, John was actually aware of it. His gaze swept across the room and there were tears in his eyes. \"Oh, Willie, thank you, darling. Thank you,\" he choked out.Wilda sorted out Sherlock's things and put some of them in the flat. The skull, files, books, several printers. She hung an old coat behind the door (which was wrapping a ridiculously ugly old jumper) and painted a yellow smiley face on the new wallpaper.She's getting used to it, John blabbing about Sherlock or drowning in his own world and his unfocused eyes. Except no one really got used to it, she was just too numb to think about it.One day, John was slouching in a wheelchair when he blurted out, sadly and quietly, \"I'm sorry.\"Wilda's heart sank, but she feigned a bright smile. \"What for?\"John sighed. \"You're stuck with your old man. Anything can be better than this-- you should go out, find a boyfriend--\"\"Boring.\" She struggled to keep her voice even.\"You sound like him, you know,\" John chuckled sadly. \"You're spoiling me. I didn't realize there was something wrong. It's too hard. I got used to it after all these years, him taking up every bit of spare space in my head...\" he trailed off.Did you love him, dad? Wilda almost asked him. But when she turned around, he had already fallen into the mist. The morning light crept in through the curtains. John woke up, with Sherlock still in his arms, seemingly asleep. He couldn't help but smile, pressing his cheek to Sherlock's warm, soft skin. He stared at the white scars across Sherlock's shoulder blades and traced the line with his lips, murmuring \"I love you\". He didn't expect an response, which was why Sherlock's deep baritone startled him. \"So do I. Morning.\" John could hear the smile in his voice. \"What did you say?\" John arched one eyebrow. \"I said, so do I.\" \"Idiot. How long have you been awake?\" John said affectionately. \"I didn't sleep.\" John could feel the rumbling voice vibrating through his chest. Sherlock turned around in his arms and kissed John. And it was so very hard to say goodbye. \"Last night...\" when they broke the kiss John said, and Sherlock stiffens instantly. John continued promptly, \"no, no, it's not like that. I'm not...regretting anything. I mean, last night, you said...you said you were leaving in the morning.\" Sherlock relaxed, and said after some thinking, \"I suppose I've changed my mind.\" \"Sorry?\" \"To hell with the mission. I'm going back to London.\" \"You mean it,\" John said bemusedly. \"Yes. I'll think of something. I will.\" \"You will?\" \"I will.\" John doesn't know what to say and he couldn't help but grin until his face hurt from the stretch. There will be problems. Countless problems, no doubt. But now, right now, he couldn't bring himeself to care at all. Wilda was twenty-nine the first time she asked John what she was wondering all along. John was sitting in his armchair, staring unseeingly into the chair opposite him. Normally he would't notice whatever Wilda did. Wilda talked to him, not really expecting an response. She took out the violin and played as a routine. That day, she played the waltz Sherlock composed.Waltz for John and Mary. It wasn't complicated, but beautiful nonetheless. A tune she learned by heart. Wilda sometimes wondered if she could reach back through the tune, along the rise and fall of each note right back to the origin, to the thoughts of a certain composing detective.It ended.\"I remember this.\" She heard John's hoarse voice.She turned and found tears streaming down his face.\"I made him my best man. The things I did...I...I didn't know...\" John raised a shaking hand and covered his eyes.\"Dad. It's all right--\"\"It isn't! He wrote to me, you see, after he had left. I went to Prague and he came to me, that night we...he said he would write to me. And he did, he wrote plenty of emails in two months and queued them, two emails each year and then he died. The idiot wanted me to think he's alive. If the bloody... thing...the system didn't go wrong, I may never have known...\"\"Dad--\"\"He just kept me in the dark!\" John simply continued brokenly, \"I...it could have been different. I should have done something. Should have told him. He didn't know. He never did. I...I...\"Wilda hesitated.\"Dad...did you love him?\"\"I...yes. I did. I do.\" John stared at the wall reflected in the mirror, the empty crime wall. His tea went cold. Soon, Sherlock would be back. He would put all kinds of things on it, maps and charts and photos. There would be a Sherlock and a John, staying at 221B Baker Street forever and ever. Together. Wilda was thirty the first time she heard gunshot in real life. She was startled awake by the sound, all sleep vanished in horror. Subconsciously she ran down the stairs to her dad's room to check. Opening the door with a slam and switching on the light, the first thing she saw was the blood on the wall.John's body lay still on the bed, a gun in his left hand, an old scarf clutched in the other. Wilda closed her eyes. She didn't scream or cry.When she opened her eyes again, she saw a note on the bedside table, not quite old, but the edges already worn. Forgive me, sweetie. I just can't go on like this. She felt an eerie calm, checked the life signs and turned around mechanically, found the phone and called the police. Distantly she could hear the shouts of her neighbours.

Invincible Defeat/一败涂地 Sherlock尽早离开了John的婚礼回到了221B。钥匙一转，门吱呀地开了。十七级台阶。他打开门，走进昏暗的客厅，把大衣脱下挂好。他终于脱身，独自一人回到他熟悉的黑暗中，迎面而来的却不是宽慰。他的目光不经意停在了墙上。 哦。 沙发靠的那一面墙上，全是他用大头钉跟胶带固定的纸片：婚礼计划，场地照片，所有繁琐的细节。就像他调查罪案时一样。 Sherlock在茶几前席地而坐，木然地盯着那面墙。 之前Mary为筹划婚礼喋喋不休的声音闪过他的脑海，遥远而模糊。婚礼结束了。他希望John的婚礼是完美的。进展还算顺利，出了点小意外，不过影响不大。结束了。一切都结束了。即使他在John的生活中还占有一席之地，他已经失去了John。一个时代的句点（the end of an era）。新篇章的开始。无论他怎么嘴硬，他是清楚的。Sherlock觉得自己的胸膛被掏空了一般，只剩疼痛。 讽刺的是，这一切都是他规划的结果。从不止一种意义上讲。 也算是他自找的。也许从一开始，他同Mycroft计划要根除Moriarty的时候这一天就写定了。只不过他蠢得看不了这么远。他甚至没考虑John会不会等着他。 但就算当初他知道有这么一天，他又有什么别的选择呢？ Sherlock微有些歇斯底里地笑了出来。明知是他不配拥有的，明知已经属于别人的，他居然还荒谬地为之痛苦。John毁了他的孤独。 暗夜视物的能力这回在背后捅了他一刀，他漠然地想着。 如果他没有这么蠢，他早该发现自己少不了John。在他从圣巴茨的屋顶跳下来之前就该发现。他早该告诉John，而或许，或许，John也是一样。 可是一切都晚了。 不知过了多久窗外有了亮色。Sherlock起身，因为久坐浑身僵硬酸疼。他没有踩着茶几而是绕了过去，走到那面墙前，把墙上的东西一样一样地取了下来。 过了一天他把John的椅子搬到了楼上。 我爱你。 直到他跟John告别，这一句他都没有说出口。他自己就发现得太晚了。 “你知道吗，其实我完全不知道该说什么。” “我也不知道。” 懦夫，Sherlock朝自己冷笑着。他想说的沉甸甸地压在心头，却无论如何出不了口。这或许是他能在John面前揭晓的最后一个谜团，一个出人意料而情理之中的答案，然而他惯用的戏剧化手段全无用武之地。仅仅是一句简单的供认，无法包装无法夸张，那字句固执地梗在他的喉中。一直以来他蔑视着常人告白前的犹豫与挣扎，然而看来他也不能免俗。 此刻即便他的大脑飞速运转也是无济于事，他茫然无措，不知道再怎么开口，几乎慌乱起来。冷静。他下意识地把所有细节尽收眼底、归档整理，气温，风的强弱，John每一丝细微的表情变化。 我爱你。 “游戏结束了。” “游戏永远不会结束的，John。……” Sherlock从来不懂该怎么告别。他开始不听大脑使唤地说个不停，东风，Mycroft，六个月。离他的死期大约还有六个月。我哥哥是这么估计的，他从来不会错。有什么想说的就该说出来。告诉他。告诉他。 也许John还是不知道的好……可他几乎不可能再见到John了。 他鼓起勇气。“John，有件事……我应该告诉你，我一直想说，但是没有机会，既然我们多半再不会相见，我觉得最好还是现在说了吧。” 那三个字眼看要在他的恐惧中出口，突然他却被另一种恐惧紧紧攫住。他不能告诉John。 他不能。 那种话从他嘴里说出，显而易见是再反常不过了，这样John会猜到他……John会猜到他是去送死。John绝对不能知道。他知道John的失落和哀伤之下藏着愤怒，对于他的离去、或许还有发生的一切怀有的愤怒。也许John这次不会再原谅他，但这总比让John知道自己会死去要好。John没有必要再经受那一切，那种Sherlock使他白白忍受了两年的痛苦。他回来之后才亲眼看到自己的假死对John的影响，那是他离开之前从未预想过的——当然，他没有预料到的实在太多。 John可以逐渐坦然面对他的缺席，他最终会从John的思绪之中消失，成为故事，成为回忆。 他身不由己。他有去无回。他知道他是断送了自己，从一开始就是。他对Magnussen开枪的一刻就完全抛掉了他的生活，三秒钟内做的决定，可他心甘情愿。这一切都是为了John。 所以不。他不能告诉John。 他深吸一口气。 我爱你。 “Sherlock其实是女孩的名字。” John笑了出来。Sherlock不禁也露出了微笑。 几天以来的第一次。能把John的笑声留在最后的回忆里，岂不也好？ “才不是吧。” “值得一试啊。” “我们不会用你的名字给女儿取名的。” “噢，我觉得可以啊。（Oh,I think it could work.）” John会忘记他，随着时间推移他会的。忘记了会比较好，没错。但是……Sherlock偏偏是那么、那么希望John不会忘记他。他的确是在试着让气氛轻松些，只是那并不真的是个玩笑。也许你会用我的名字给你的孩子取名吧，也许你会想念我，你大概是唯一一个可能想念我的人。（Maybe you’ll name the baby after me and remember me fondly, you’re likely the only one who will.） 想想他永远也见不到John的小女儿……想想看如果她叫Sherlock Watson。那该有多讽刺。 Sherlock摘下了手套，伸出手去。 “致最美好的时光，John。” John低头看着Sherlock的手，又抬起眼，目光在Sherlock的手和脸之间移动着。最终他一偏头，盯着Sherlock的双眼，也伸出手来握住了Sherlock的手。 John失望了，Sherlock看得出，但他还能怎样呢……再进一步，Sherlock会发疯一样去夺取不属于他的东西。John会知道。为时已晚。 他握着John的手。他要记住John皮肤的感觉。温暖，真实，还有Sherlock自己神经中的钝痛。 John的手被Sherlock放开。他看着Sherlock转身离去。就这样而已？ John的身体先他大脑一步迈出了脚，也许近一点，也许拍一下Sherlock的肩膀，也许再一个拥抱……这不够。这远远不够。可John没再往前走一步。Sherlock没有回头，渐渐走远，上了飞机。John只是盯着机门，退开，跟Mary站到一起。 所以就这样了。 Sherlock又一次离开了，去东欧卧底，之后会在某个不知名的鬼地方继续他的冒险，去一个John跟不到的地方。 John知道Sherlock是因为他才不得不离开。这傻瓜明明说过自己不是英雄，却偏偏不顾一切地一枪打死了Magnussen，自己扛下了所有。John知道他应该心怀感激，如果不是Sherlock事情不知道会变成什么样，可是…… John本该跟他一起承担一切的，不是吗？一起并肩而战、出生入死，直到最后？Sherlock自作主张地剥夺了他的选择，这傻瓜用自我牺牲把他推开了。如果形势所迫，John真的可以跟Sherlock一起走上绝路不再回头，可Sherlock却完全不愿这样。John不免觉得受了冒犯。Sherlock就要这样忽视John的想法吗？他认为John需要保护吗？ Sherlock凭什么这么自以为是，单方面地做下这样的决定？ 但John知道自己这么想并不公平——Sherlock是为了他才这么做的。John现在有了Mary，有了家庭，有了他自己的责任。错不在Sherlock，Sherlock做了他所能做的一切。 他因为自己反添了几分怒气。他没法安然地看着Sherlock离去，没法自私地庆幸，没法若无其事地继续自己的生活。 他退到安全区域，看着飞机起飞，离开。Mary紧紧地握着他的手。Sherlock又一次走了，从他的生活中离开了。只不过这一次不一样，对不对？这家伙会在世界上某个角落里继续生活，继续做个不可思议的天才，偶尔会想起John，也许还是带着怀念想起John。 这也是种安慰。这也就够了。 John不断告诉自己这就够了，绝望地想看那飞机掉头飞回来，想让Sherlock回来，不管是因为出了多么大的乱子，哪怕Moriarty活过来也无所谓。但这不可能。飞机远了，逐渐变作一个小小的点。 混蛋，又把我撇下了。不管你要去哪，照顾好自己。 也许我会想你。妈的，我肯定会想你。 Part II - As If It's Real/恍若真实 John又开始梦见Sherlock。 他经常在梦里跟着Sherlock跑遍了伦敦的大街小巷，耳畔是血液上涌的轰鸣，枪柄顶着他的后背，他的腿因为奔跑发酸，但他所向无敌。只是跑着跑着，Sherlock便不见了。 最后孩子的名字是John取的。最后，从某种形式上来说，确实是用Sherlock的名字命了名。John给女儿起名叫Wilda。Mary同意用这个名字。 当John第一次把她抱在怀里，看着这个纤小的奇迹。 喜悦之余他隐隐觉得失落。 John盯着电脑屏幕。他打开了博客的编辑页，却完全不知道该写什么。他觉得自己该写点什么，至少是给自己一个交代。对于公众来讲Sherlock等于是失踪了，有人在评论里向他发问，有那么一段时间哪里都有跟着他的记者，但后来没有了。都没有了。 他不在乎别人怎么想。Sherlock对他们来说不过是又一类故事，一种茶余饭后的消遣。新的热点层出不穷，他们的兴趣也就随之烟消云散。 距上次更新几乎有一年了。当然，那甚至不是他的更新，是Sherlock黑了他的账号胡乱写的一篇。这更像Sherlock的作风，说实在的，John简直不敢相信Sherlock在他的婚礼上能够那么……正经。 那也许是John最快乐的一天。就算婚礼上那个意外也没破坏他的回忆，他的确为Sholto上校担心了一阵，可是化险为夷之后他偶尔也会跟自己承认有那么点刺激也是不错的。说真的，比起随后发生的一切，那段日子简直幸福得如同幻梦。 不过谁的运气都有用尽的时候，是不是？他苦涩地想。 他想起Sherlock帮他筹划婚礼的时候对他爆满的收件箱置之不理。 他想起婚礼上后来没了影的Sherlock为他和Mary谱的曲子，Sherlock郑重的誓言。第一次也是最后一次。 他想起了Sherlock开玩笑说有了真的孩子就不再需要他之后的表情。 他不知道Sherlock对他是怎么想的。每当他以为自己瞥见了Sherlock身上的柔软之处，每当Sherlock有意无意说出口的话让他心头一暖，每当他以为他们之间不仅是友谊，他所见的一切便转瞬即逝，Sherlock要么显得更加不近人情，要么飞快地转移了话题。 如果他能对自己坦诚些，他知道自己爱Sherlock，他只是不喜欢承认。他甚至告诉过Sherlock，因为他确信Sherlock不太可能会回应他的情感（跟工作结了婚，嗯？）。他从来没问过。他不确定自己是不是真想知道Sherlock的答案，如果一切是他多想，他会毁了一切。Sherlock不在的那两年里他意识到自己不能再痴想着一个死去的人，人总不能一直渴望自己得不到的东西。（One can’t always want what one will never have.）而且……他遇到了Mary。Sherlock回来之后，他就不敢再想这个问题了。 他很擅长不去想这个问题。 当初他确实是爱上了Mary。他下定决心求婚的时候，他们交往并不久，但Mary带他一点一点走出了悲伤的阴影。她聪明，风趣，思维异于常人，而且接受了真实的他。那么早求婚也许匆忙，但他当时深信他们在一起会幸福。他迫切地需要填补Sherlock在他生命中留下的空洞，他几乎就成功了，离安于平淡的生活只差一步。 然后Sherlock回来了。 如果他没有遇见Mary…… 他抬手揉了揉太阳穴。别再想了。他跟Mary的周年纪念也快到了，不如想想这个。对，想想他们要做些什么。 John裸身站在水中，面前浮着一个白色的椭球，内部似乎是空的，足够容下一个人。像是个巨大的茧。他伸手一碰，表面便裂开了，里面竟真有个蛹。蛹也一破，露出了Sherlock的脸。Sherlock的眼睛忽地睁开，两点异色聚焦在John的脸上。 Sherlock张开嘴仿佛要说什么，但没有声音，于是艰难地试图挣脱束缚。John正想帮忙，Sherlock已经奋力用手撕裂了蛹，坐起身来。青色的血管在他手臂的皮肤之下若隐若现。 Sherlock就这么抬头望着他，神情幽深难测。空气中的热度悄然之间缓缓攀升。他抽身而出，迈进水里，赤裸而苍白地站在John的面前。 突然之间Sherlock闭眼，倾身吻了John，双手捧着John的脸。John不知什么时候闭上了眼，不知怎么自然而然开始狂热地回吻，手抚着Sherlock的背脊。那皮肤微带湿润，诡异地有着蜡一样的质感。 Sherlock的吻进而落在John的嘴角，John的脸颊，John的下颌。水开始漫上来，漫过了他们的腰，漫上胸口，漫至颈部，漫过头顶，直到他们完全淹没在水下。他们躺在水底，没有停下，根本不需要呼吸。Sherlock跨坐在John的大腿上，俯下身来，吸噬着他的唇，两手在John头的两侧支撑着自己的重量。John一手环住Sherlock的阴茎上下套弄，另一手抚摩着Sherlock的肩胛、顺着脊柱向下直到Sherlock的臀瓣，手指按摩起Sherlock的入口，然后探了进去，开拓着Sherlock。不久Sherlock不耐烦地挪动起来，一手抓住John的阴茎，引着它进入了自己，缓缓下坐。John被那紧窒的湿热包裹着，全部的理智溃不成军，他牢牢地把着Sherlock的臀部，开始抽送。因为隔着水，他的节奏不得不被减慢，但一切是如此完美—— John猛地醒来，下床踉踉跄跄进了卫生间。他释放出自己的挫败，为了不出声咬着手臂，羞愧难当。这还是遇见Mary之后的第一次。 John阴郁地感觉也许不是最后一次。 完事后他把自己清理干净回到了床上。Mary醒了，担忧地看着他，但是没来得及说什么Wilda哭了起来，她忙去给孩子喂奶。 之后他们什么也没说。 John知道，有的人说谎的时候可能自己都没有意识到。他们中的一些也许真心实意地相信自己说的是真的，或者至少希望是真的，希望说出了口就成了真的，于是慌忙中用言语给自己画了一条界线、束上一副镣铐。 时间久了才意识到镣铐的重量。 他知道。他说原谅了Sherlock的时候是这样，他说原谅了Mary的时候也是这样。他渐渐还是原谅了Sherlock，但还没有原谅Mary。 他觉得Mary似乎也知道这一点。Mary在……躲避他。倒不是说她看上去像是在着意在躲，她只是一门心思投在他们的女儿身上而已，但是John还是能够察觉到。Mary若无其事地继续着他们的生活，他们都刻意不去提她的过去，不提Sherlock，仿佛Sherlock从未死而复生。然而一切都不一样了。谈话间他们眼神相遇的时候越来越少，拌嘴之后的沉默变得愈加冰冷，每天入睡前的吻像是出自义务一般。 他不能说自己不为发生的一切责怪Mary。他知道自己不该这样，但是他停不住。如果他不爱Mary，他不会选择跟她结婚，事到如今，他却觉得自己无法再信任她。他发觉Mary的另一部分他其实一直隐隐约约地能找见一些影子，她聪明，机警，说起谎来毫无破绽，等等——他甚至喜欢她这些地方——却从来没发现她令人胆寒的冷酷。她对Sherlock开过枪，不管Sherlock怎么替她说话，他知道当时在手术台上Sherlock的心跳停了。她差点再次把Sherlock从他身边夺去。 而如今Sherlock因为他们离开了。因为她而离开了。 他看得出Mary知道他怨她。他偶尔发现Mary会哀伤地望着他，发现他在看的时候就收走目光。 一切到底还是因她而起的。 Mrs Hudson告诉John，221B要租出去了，Sherlock的东西Mycroft都会收走。她问他想不想先拿走什么作纪念。 他知道Sherlock的小提琴被Sherlock带走了，他考虑过要不要头骨，后来觉得算了。他拿走了牛头，挂在自家客厅墙上。他犹豫了很久，还是拿了Sherlock的一条围巾，放在床头柜的抽屉里。 如果Mary发现了，她没有表现出来。 John去布拉格参加医学会议。其中一天他听过所有讲座、随便吃了一顿晚饭之后，回到了宾馆。他进了房间门，打开了灯。 然后发现Sherlock坐在一把椅子上看着他。 Part III - Consenting to Be Wrecked/自甘沉沦 John的第一反应是他走错了房间。他深吸一口气，眨眨眼睛，发现不是幻觉，确定了自己不是在做梦。 “Sherlock。”John低声说，仿佛呓语一般。 “我知道我来得有点突然。”Sherlock开腔，紧张地望着John。 John很长时间不知道说什么，其间Sherlock只是扫视着他。John好奇他都看出了什么。 “你怎么在这里？”John总算找回了自己的声音，问题一出口却立刻后悔了。 Sherlock低头。“我碰巧来了这里，才得到消息说你也在，我想也许我可以……算了。你也许不想见到我。我留得够久了——”Sherlock站了起来。 “不！不。别走。我没有——我是说，见到你我很高兴。”John走上前去。“坐吧。”他面朝Sherlock坐在床上。 一阵沉默。Sherlock坐下来，还是望着他。Sherlock甚至比以往更加苍白瘦削，眼中血丝密布，他的头发比John上一次见他的时候要短很多，他的穿着也变了风格，可能是因为他有意想要被淹没在人群之中。但无论怎样John不会认不出是他。 John没说谎，他是很高兴……但同时也完全不知所措。 “我给孩子起名叫Wilda。”John说。 “噢。这样。”Sherlock顿了一下。“她一定很漂亮。” “她很完美。” “Mary怎么样？” “她很好。” “你一直没有更新博客。” “我……不打算再写了。” “噢。” 又是沉默。该死的沉默。 “221B租出去了。” “噢。” John想了想，还是问了：“你呢，你这些日子怎么样？” Sherlock咬了咬唇。“显而易见，我还好端端地在这儿。” “你为什么……来找我？”需要帮助？有只能当面问的事（John的心猛地沉了下来）？他总不可能是来叙旧的。 “我……”Sherlock看上去很犹豫。“我是想……向你要一样东西。（I meant to…ask something of you.）” 果不其然。“是什么？”John轻声问。 Sherlock又站了起来，似乎想逃离这个房间。“算了。这也许不是个好主意。我还是——”但John跟了上去，抓住了他的手腕。Sherlock随之猛地转身，但是没有把手抽开，他在原位僵住不动，低头看着John的脸，仿佛是在寻找着什么，眼神绝望如受困的野鸟。 John突然明白了。他明白了Sherlock伴郎致辞里所说的每一个字都是真心实意，明白了Sherlock自作主张开枪射杀Magnussen的理由。他明白了Sherlock之前跟他道别的时候本来想说什么，或许这傻瓜还是没过了他自己这一关。 John也过不了自己这一关。 天啊。他居然找Sherlock当他的伴郎，如果他当初知道…… John没放开手，又走近一步，Sherlock呼吸一滞。此时此刻他们之间几乎没了距离。 “是什么，Sherlock？”John低语道。 Sherlock轻颤着呼出一口气，然后吻了他。 嘴唇的相触顷刻之间变得令人晕眩，John想也没想便回吻着，Sherlock呜咽一声，在他的唇下张开双唇，Sherlock的手紧紧抓住John的肩膀，John的手抚上Sherlock的后颈，只愿对方再近些。Sherlock忽地断开变得濡湿而热切的吻，试着平复呼吸，额头靠着John的额头。 John气喘吁吁地说：“天啊，也许我——” “别说你本不该这么做。”Sherlock退了开来，唐突地打断了他。 “好吧。”John回答，没有动地方。他开始感到羞耻了：他背叛了Mary，背叛了他的家庭。“我甚至不确定这是不是真的发生了。……你说你想要什么？就是这个？” “不。不是。不只是。我是说……”Sherlock深吸一口气，恼怒地摇了摇头，闭上了眼睛。“我是想……看看你的疤痕。” John眨了眨眼，然后皱起了眉头。 “为什么？” 短暂的沉默。“这是……唯一一样我没法完全想象出的东西。”Sherlock咽了咽口水。“我建了一份关于你的档案，在我的大脑里，其他所有信息我都逐渐收集好了，或是能推断出来，只缺你的疤痕。直到我……离开之后我才想起来。这一次是碰巧我们在一个地方，也是侥幸我没有人跟着，以后我基本不可能再见到你了，甚至不能联系你。我不希望我做的事让你……受牵连。” “慢着，不管你是在做什么，那很危险？” Sherlock不耐烦地挥了挥手。“这不要紧。” “这当然相当他妈的要紧！如果你不在乎自己的性命，我碰巧没法想到你可能死在某个地方，还能在几千里外悠哉地喝茶——” “我知道我在做什么。”Sherlock打断了他，但忽然眉头紧锁。Sherlock停了停，然后坚定的说：“我保证，一旦这工作完成了，就没有什么可担心的了。也许需要继续隐姓埋名，不过不会有危险。” John将信将疑地看着他。“你最好是说真的，否则我现在就给你好看。” Sherlock扬起一条眉毛。“当然。现在回归正题吧。” John考虑起来。Sherlock的着眼点永远异乎常人。John并不觉得自己的疤痕是种耻辱，但它绝不使他引以为傲，他不知道把它暴露在Sherlock的目光下，那咨询侦探会看到什么。有人（也就是说跟他上过床的女朋友们）盯着他的疤痕看的时候他总会觉得不舒服，仿佛对于她们，他身上带着的并不只是子弹穿过的印迹，还有什么令人望而生畏的东西（倒不是说Sherlock也会这样，Sherlock肯定不会这样）。Mary是例外，然而现在想来……简直可笑。 一阵潜藏的愤怒又探出了头。John摇摇头，仿佛这样就能把Mary赶出脑海。 John叹了口气，做了决定。 “如果你坚持这样，也可以，”John说。“不过我有条件。” “什么条件？”Sherlock听上去微微有些惊讶。 John开始怀疑自己是不是个受虐狂。“你要给我看你的。” 惊慌瞬间闪过Sherlock的面孔。“不行。” “公平交易。再说……也没有什么我没见过的。我……我知道你后背有疤痕。”Sherlock还在医院的时候John看到过一点。之后他一直没问。之后他要想的东西太多了。 “可是——” “否则就算了。” Sherlock犹豫着，最终点了点头。 John的手已经挪到了衬衫的前襟。“一起？” 看着John解开衬衫、脱下衬衫里面的T恤，Sherlock默默地脱了夹克，一个扣子一个扣子地解开，露出的下腹却还有一条不短的、刚刚缝过针的纵向伤口。线还没有拆。 “Sherlock！”John惊呼道。“你个骗子，你刚才还说——” “John。别这样。” Sherlock声音里有一种深深的疲惫，John不禁把他的质问咽了回去。John跪下身来，视线与那伤口平齐。他检视着伤口。 “看来只是皮肉伤，处理得还算可以。好像是要留疤的。（Seems like it’s going to scar.）”John的声音紧绷着。 或许都留不了。（Probably won’t get to.）Sherlock想着。他心不在焉地脱掉衬衫，目光定在前方。 Sherlock在思考。他说漏了嘴，现在只有想该怎么弥补。John刚刚对他说了什么，似乎是在说Mary的子弹给他留下的疤痕，他随口答了一句。他不该来的，他一开始就不该来的，可他还是抵制不住再见到John的诱惑。John不能知道他会死去。而即使他已经超出了Mycroft的预期，他完全不清楚自己还能挺多久。有人在触摸他的背，Sherlock惊得几乎一缩，不过——噢，那只能是John。John的手指轻轻地顺着他的一条疤痕走着。“是什么时候？（When?）”他背后传来John哽住的声音。 “基本都是在塞尔维亚，我在那里被抓住了，试着逃出来，没有成功。Mycroft把我弄出来的，紧接着我就回来了。” “就是说你在餐厅出现的那天……你背上还带着伤？” Sherlock没有回答。他总不能说没错。他总不能说有几处伤裂开了。 “天啊，那天我做的事……我简直是……看在老天分上，我居然还把你按在地上！……” “John。别。那时候已经愈合得差不多了。”那也许是他应得的，为他的愚蠢，为他的疏忽。 过了一会，John似乎平复了情绪，抬头望着他，挤出一个微笑，说：“我记得是你先要看我的疤的。”Sherlock回过神来。 那时候他本来想说，上了我。（Take me.）这会是他的第一次，如果可能，他希望也会是最后一次。他不怕痛，甚至希望会痛，希望会痛上一段时间。无疑会影响他的运动能力，但痛感会让他想起John。他会带着病态的迷恋等着John在他身上留下的最后印迹一点、一点地消失。 最后一刻他又变了主意。他说的也是真的，他确实在思维宫殿中设着John的档案，他也确实缺少John伤疤的信息。只是他想要的还有更多更多，更多他永远没有机会了解的东西。 他不知不觉已经向John左肩那星状的疤痕伸出了手，等他意识到，刚想收回来，John的手已经捉住了他的手。John握着他的手，贴在John的疤痕上。 于是Sherlock迟疑着开始触摸。他记下了它的形状，它的触感，然后又绕到John背后看子弹射出的地方，做了同样的事。他放下手时，John转过身来，直视着他的眼睛，手伸上来扶着Sherlock的后颈。 一时鲁莽，Sherlock又吻了John，又在John张开嘴唇之后加深了这个吻。John犹豫着回吻了。 “上了我。（Take me.）”这一次他们为呼吸断开这个吻的时候，Sherlock不禁说出了口。 John一僵。他听到了，Sherlock慌乱地想。他等着John的柔和而坚定的拒绝。 但John只是静静地看着他，一言不发。最后，John吻上Sherlock的嘴唇，带着Sherlock上了床。 我爱你。 事后，John把他们两个清理干净，他们在被单下紧贴着，Sherlock把头埋在John的颈窝，深深地呼吸着。Sherlock比John想象中的更暖。 “我有伤到你吗？”John有些紧张。 “没有。” “那就好。你是在……闻我？” “信息存档。”Sherlock嘟哝着。John不禁笑了，之后他们什么也没说。 Sherlock挪开了一点，叹了口气，打破了沉默。“明天早上我就得离开。” John听着，不置可否地“嗯”了一声。他觉得胸膛里有什么抽紧了一样，但他知道这无可避免。 我爱你。 他没有说出口，现在再去后悔从前的选择已经晚了。别让一切毫无必要地更加难熬。（No need to make it any harder than it has to be.） 五年的执念被迫画上了句点，就这一夜。只有这一夜。此时此刻只有他们两个。这是出轨，但他现在拒绝面对自己的愧疚。不是现在。不是在他即将再次失去Sherlock的时候。 长长的、长长的静默之后，Sherlock突然说：“我也许可以给你写信。”随后又补了一句：“但也不一定。我不做任何保证。（No promises.）” John应了一声好，让Sherlock转过身去，从背后搂住他，手环在Sherlock的腰上，在Sherlock的肩上浅浅印下一个吻。 我爱你。 Sherlock的手覆在John的手上，引着John的一只手上移，停在了Sherlock的胸口。 他不知道自己是什么时候睡着的，醒来的时候，Sherlock不见了，他旁边的床已经冰凉。 那天下午他在外套内袋里发现一张字条，是Sherlock潦草的字迹。 “关于你的档案完整了。（The file on you is complete.）”上面写着。 John把字条小心地折好，放进了钱包的夹层。他觉得自己整个人都空了。 Part IV - Slipping into the Masterpiece/误蔽双眼 John想过要不要告诉Mary，最后他没有。他觉得这只能属于他和Sherlock。 他不会对自己承认的，但他心里确实有那么一部分觉得Mary没有权利知道。 从布拉格回来两个月后的一天，John在凌晨两点被一条短信吵醒。恍惚之间他以为是Sherlock，以为自己还在221B。但是他发现是陌生的号码，一下子清醒了。 短信写的是：我爱你。不要忘记我。 他皱起眉头，突然同一个号码又发来一条新的信息。 对不起，发错号码了。 果然。John把手机放回去，但是之后没有睡着。 就在John学会了对Sherlock的话不抱太大期望的时候，他收到了第一封邮件。那是次年的一月二十九日。挑这样一个日子简直是难以置信地情绪化，但是……John想，也不足为奇。也算是Sherlock的作风。邮件来自一个陌生的邮箱，没有起首，没有署名。 主题：一切正常 按照我说的那样，我发邮件了。不要回复。为了防止别人追踪，我做了点措施，如果你回信我是收不到的。 我还好。那处伤口结疤了。前段时间我多了一道子弹擦伤，不过其他一切正常。这些事就快要结束了，也许再等上两三个月就好。之后我得避避风头，在无聊中尽力不把自己折磨疯。也许我会研究研究太阳系，现代文学，诸如此类没用的东西。等那时候我就可以计划一下以后要做什么，要去哪里。这地方没有像样的茶。有时我会想念你泡的茶。 只能写这么多了，我还有事情要做。我会再写邮件来。 短得让John有几分失望，但他还是很欣慰。至少他没有那么担心了。 John觉得他跟Mary越来越疏远了。他觉得他们现在仅仅是在同一个屋檐下照顾同一个孩子而已。他不觉得奇怪，只是无奈。他心里带着一点罪恶感，他知道他对她把自己一点一点封闭了起来。 他甚至偶尔想过离婚，但他尽力打消了这种念头。也许还是可以补救的，他们只是需要好好谈谈。 但他一直没开口。 那一年的八月John收到了第二封邮件。同一个邮箱，还是没有起首，没有署名。 主题：（算是）安顿好了 任务完成。我暂且找了个地方住，也许会久留。我不能告诉你是哪里。以后可能还会有类似的差事找我来做，我不能冒险让人发现，所以很遗憾你不能回信给我。 不知道Wilda是什么样。真希望我能见见她。 我真的不会写信。我都不知道写什么好。到现在为止没有什么值得写的东西。也就是说我现在实在是太无聊了。如果你在，你毫无疑问会拉我看一堆无聊的电视节目。我试过了，感觉不太好。避风头。避风头。看在老天分上，简直乏味得要死。我该试着找个案子。 希望你一切都好。我会再写邮件来。 Mary的车祸是一次意外，当时天色很晚，司机看到她的时候已经太迟了。Wilda没有了母亲。葬礼办得比较简单，来的人并不多。Wilda全程一直睡在John的怀抱里。 从一开始的震惊之中恢复过来之后，John隐隐感到麻木的悔恨。他有太多、太多该说的该做的事，如今却只剩一块冰冷的墓碑。 他没有太多时间去哀悼，Wilda还需要他。他工作，他搬了家，他照顾自己的女儿。两个月之后Wilda没有再找过妈妈。John每个月在Mary的墓碑前放一束花。 他不知道自己是有了面对的经验，还是他确实没有那么伤心。每天的忙碌让他无心深思。 主题：无聊 希望你一切都好。 偶尔我还会跟你说话，这很蠢，你并不在旁边。有时候我想不起来。我发现自己会写很多没有用的东西给你然后全部删掉。 你知道，我刚回来之后找Molly一起办案，只有那一天。在犯罪现场我还会在脑子里听到你的声音。现在偶尔也会，我脑袋里的你总是在让我吃些什么或者睡觉。 不知道221B变了多少。当然，对我是无所谓，我在思维宫殿里存了一个副本，是你刚搬进来一个月后的样子。我偷过你两件毛衣，其中一件藏在卧室里，不知道新住户收拾的时候有没有发现。Mycroft一定把我的东西都挪走了，但是他肯定找不到的。不知道你有没有带走什么，你知道，我的东西应该由你随便处置的。如果你拿了什么纪念品，一定是牛头，虽然我私下希望你拿走了头骨。 John并不好，但他还过得去。Sherlock似乎不知道Mary的车祸，John觉得有些奇怪，但是John没有更新过博客，Mycroft很有可能不屑于告诉Sherlock（或者他跟Sherlock联系不多？）。也有可能Sherlock知道但是刻意没有提。也许这更有可能，Sherlock不擅长这类事。他叹了口气，关上电脑，列起了购物单，Wilda在他附近安静地玩着玩具。 他一边心不在焉地列着用完的生活必需品，一边克制着自己不要好奇Sherlock拿走的另一件毛衣在哪里。 Sherlock大约半年左右给John发一封邮件，时间不定。后来他会在邮件里简单地给John讲一个案子，于是邮件长了一点。John会因为怀旧微微伤感。再想起他跟Sherlock查案的日子总有恍若隔世之感，他会思念危险带来的肾上腺素，思念Sherlock快步走的时候大衣微微飘起的下摆，思念凌晨时刻的小提琴。最初这种思念会让他夜里不觉蜷起身体，但他慢慢学会了适应平淡。他现在过着他自己的生活，他有他的Wilda。 渐渐地，John不会刻意去查新邮件了。收到Sherlock的邮件，他心头还是会涌起淡淡的欣喜。那让他知道Sherlock也在世界上的某个角落继续着自己的生活，和John一样。如今他们天各一方，但一封简单的邮件对于John还是种隐约的安慰。 而既然Sherlock的邮件没有断过，也许John对于他也是一样。 有时候，只是有时候，John会梦见他们在一起的那个夜晚，第一次也是最后一次。 在那些梦里，他的唇贴在Sherlock柔软的皮肤表面，他轻喃着温柔的私语，仿佛这样他每一分的渴望与思慕就能潜入Sherlock的皮肤之下，汇入血脉，盘桓不去。他告诉Sherlock他爱他，一遍又一遍。 然后梦醒了。现在哪怕他写下来，哪怕他说出口，Sherlock也不会知道了。 他知道后悔没有用，但他应该告诉Sherlock。他本来应该告诉Sherlock。 开始他偶尔还会找Greg出去喝一杯，他有时候会去看看Mrs Hudson。后来联系也少了，把他们连在一起的疯子已经不见了。 Wilda上了幼儿园后的一年，John有了很久以来的第一次约会。她叫Rosalind，比他年轻不少。他们是在一家超市相遇的，当时Wilda开心地指着女人的裙子说她喜欢这个颜色。然后女人跟他聊了起来。John似乎还是没忘记怎么调情，Rosalind把号码留给了他。 他犹豫了一两天，还是打了电话。后来他们又见了两三次面，Rosalind似乎很喜欢他。最后一回他送她回家，她请他进屋喝咖啡。 John接受了她的邀请。他很清楚这意味着什么。 Rosalind在厨房泡着咖啡，John打量着她的客厅，看了看书架上都摆着什么书，突然发现靠上一层架子上摆着一个头骨。 Rosalind端着咖啡向他走来，发现他盯着那一层看。“怎么？（Well？）” John指了指头骨，在过脑子之前就问了出来：“是你的朋友？（Friend of yours？）” “哦！那个！”女人大笑起来。“万圣节的时候我跟一帮朋友在这搞了个派对，我跟别人借了这个当摆设，还没还回去呢。我总忘。你看他眼熟？”她揶揄道。 John勉强挤出两声笑，开始想要逃出去喝一杯。他找了借口离开，去了一间酒吧。他已经托了朋友照顾Wilda一晚上。开始他想，就喝一杯。就喝一杯。只要让酒精把他脑袋里的Sherlock没过去就好。 后来他都不知道自己是怎么回家的。 之后他没有再联系过Rosalind。他也没有再约过会。 John换了钱包。 他留着Sherlock的字条，犹豫片刻，放进了新钱包的夹层，藏在Wilda的照片底下。 Wilda渐渐长大了。出他意料的是，她很喜欢侦探故事。他跟她讲了几个他跟Sherlock办过的案子（当然，删去了一些不合适的内容）。他的小姑娘拍手惊叹着，想要听更多。 开始他讲得很高兴，后来发现他能讲的不多，而讲剩下的案子也越来越少。他发觉自己已经快忘了Sherlock有了发现的时候眉飞色舞的样子，Sherlock抛出一系列推理的时候连珠炮一样的语气，谜团解开时Sherlock闪闪发光的双眼。 发现这些回忆变得模糊让他一阵惊恐。但它们只是藏在了他的回忆里，蒙了尘，并没有消失不见。他舒了口气。 到了现在他也许能承认，他很庆幸自己没有忘记Sherlock身上最让他迷醉的地方。 再收到Sherlock的邮件时，他发觉Sherlock的口吻仿佛是John只不过出了差在别的地方、而Sherlock还窝在221B想办法消磨时光。他的朋友还是有令人羡慕的记忆力。John的“档案”。 或许Sherlock一直都假装John在他身边？John随即否认了这一想法。这不太现实。 可如果他能回信，他一定会问的。就算是用开玩笑的口吻。也许Sherlock会说没错。也许。谁知道呢。 一天他打开邮箱，照例查邮件。他没期望着能有Sherlock的邮件，离上一封只有两个多月。 但是那一天有Sherlock的邮件。一连十七封。John连忙看了寄出时间，发现都是同一时刻发送的。 John突然感觉呼吸变得困难了许多。 一定有什么出错了。一定是的。John没有别的方法，觉得只能问Mycroft。如果有谁清楚Sherlock的现状，那只能是Mycroft。他设法找到了Mycroft的号码，但是……John知道这号码很旧了。离上一次已经有六年了，他没有把握能不能联系上。 电话通了。但是很长时间没有人接听。John咬牙等着。 终于有人接了起来。 “John。”John认出电话那端是Mycroft的声音，他听上去有些讶异。 John松了口气，至少他不用跑到第欧根尼俱乐部去。他想直接问起Sherlock，但想起了Sherlock为了保密做下的那些措施。“我们需要谈谈。”最终John是这么说的。 另一边沉默了许久，最后Mycroft说：“我会再联系你。”然后挂断了。 John想要冲他叫喊，但是再打过去的时候没有人接听了。Mycroft最好他妈说话算话。 当天下午他心烦意乱地出了门，把Wilda送到她朋友家过夜。回途上一辆黑色的车靠近，停在他身边。他上了车，里面坐着Mycroft。六年不见，他看上去老了很多。 “我相信你不是找我来叙旧的，John。”Mycroft冷淡地拖着长腔说道。 “我需要……这是关于Sherlock的。” Mycroft面无表情。“关于Sherlock的什么？” “他……他给我写信。他会发邮件给我，一直都是，大概半年一次。我肯定那是他。但是今天他……他一连发了十七封邮件。离上次才两个多月，十七封的发送时间都是一样的。一定是出了问题。你应该知道发生了什么。” Mycroft只是看着他，眼神毫无生气，什么也不说。 “Mycroft？我们总该弄明白是怎么回事，做点什么——” “Sherlock死了。”Mycroft打断了他。 车里安静得可怕。 “什——什么？” “Sherlock死了。”Mycroft紧闭上了眼睛，突然显得很疲惫。 “这……这最好不是你们又在耍什么把戏——” “我想你们在布拉格还见过一面。” “……没错。” “那之后两个月他就死了。” Part V - We Gather Up Our Hearts and Go/曲终人散 （Sherlock知道自己的身份暴露了。他刚刚毁掉自己电脑里的全部数据，然后把一切丢在他藏身的屋子里。现在起他随时可能被人找到，只是时间问题。他出了门，买了一部预付话费的手机，敲出一个他记得烂熟的号码，发了一条短信。 他当即准备把手机处理掉，但是又突然后悔了。于是他又发了一条信息。 对不起，发错号码了。 他处理掉手机，然后在两个选择中摇摆不定：是自我了断，还是束手待毙并祈祷抓到他的人到时候能给他个痛快。） “这不可能。”John木然地说。 “我去辨认的尸体。的确是他。”Mycroft揉起了太阳穴。“他身份暴露，在被对方找到之前自杀了。他走的时候就不让我告诉你。” “他说——”John摇着头。 “我之前看了你的邮箱，查了一下他使用的账号，我相信他是提前写好了那些信，使用了定时发送，而后来他用的邮箱系统出了故障，于是今天你收到了剩下所有的邮件。” “天啊——” “他走的时候是去执行一项自杀任务。我都没有预料到他能活那么久。” Mycroft平板的语气几乎让John狂怒。“什么！？你就这么让他去了？真不敢相信你还能够说出这种话来！” “我……能力有限。”Mycroft低下了头。 “你他妈是全英国最有权势的人！什么样的人会让自己的弟弟——” “你以为我有选择吗？”Mycroft突然厉声打断了他。“我警告过他不要搅这趟浑水，他根本没有听！而如果他不是为了你还有你的杀手妻子做了傻事，事态根本不会到那个地步！就为了你他要去维护那么一个女人的安全——” “你没有权利这么说！” “——然后搭上了他自己的性命！他根本不考虑前因后果，不清楚他的举动会带来什么影响。我的手给绑住了。”Mycroft的声音开始变得不稳。“我有权力，但我不是不受人制约的。这任务他们之前就想加给Sherlock，我拦了下来，我试着告诉Sherlock，但是他没有明白。我对此已经无能为力了。我为他对我们的父母说了谎。他抛弃了自己的一切，到头来却不想让你知道，还要求我对你隐瞒他的死讯。” John张开嘴，却不知道该说什么。 “他就这么去了。本来他也许可以脱身的，只要他愿意，他可以失踪，可以骗过我们任何人。也许没法再回到英国，但他可以去什么别的地方，查查案子，养养蜜蜂。我觉得他不想。”Mycroft的声音低了下来。他苦笑着摇了摇头，显得精疲力竭，仿佛为自己的爆发感到难堪。“你拨的号码一直是为他设的，John。隔了五年电话响了，想想我有多吃惊。 “我相信我已经说得够多了。”Mycroft举起颤抖的手盖住了眼睛。“我没能完成我最重要的任务，Dr Watson，这一点我不需要你来提醒我。” 为什么？ John扯着头发在他空荡荡的家里来回踱步。 Sherlock。Sherlock。SHERLOCK。死了。不在了。这傻瓜以为他是谁？他觉得自己是那么高明，是吗，什么都预想到了。永远先人一步。他是从一开始就认定了跟John不会有结果，于是根本没管John有没有可能回馈他的感情吗？他宁肯抽身而出一声不响地为John自戕，也不敢冒一次险把自己交付出去，打破他那冰冷的外壳？他凭什么要……他凭什么？自以为是的混蛋，他觉得把John蒙在鼓里，John就能照常生活下去？用一个精心的谎言给John一种甜苦交杂的幻觉，连知情和哀悼的权利都不给John？一切本来可以有所不同的。不是必须走到这一步的。本来可以不一样的。 然而至少Sherlock是鼓起了勇气的，他来找John了不是吗。天啊，要是他都没发现John实际上对他是……一样的？他一定以为John在怜悯他…… 这些指控并不公平，就算它们占据着John的思想，John也是知道的。难道他自己就不懦弱吗？难道他隐瞒了自己的想法的时候，他就不一样了吗？ 是我。我本来该告诉他的。 一切本来可以有所不同的。不是必须走到这一步的。本来可以不一样的。哪怕中途会波折重重。 而他怎么能把责任推卸给Sherlock——有着一个天才的大脑却想不到自己是John最好朋友的Sherlock？为了他的婚礼在Youtube上学怎么叠餐巾的Sherlock？为了他和Mary的第一支舞写了一首华尔兹的Sherlock？ 是John一直都没有说。一直没有。 John颤抖的膝盖再也支撑不住了。他跪倒在地上，久违的泪水涌出眼眶。 第二天下午他把Wilda接了回来，带着她去购物，回家，给她做饭，在她玩的时候坐在沙发上睡着了一会。 “爸爸，你没事吧？” “没事，亲爱的，没事。我只是……有点累。” 哄Wilda上床睡觉之后，他瘫坐在沙发上，毫无意识地盯着前方。 一个月后他一个人出去买东西，他一时冲动走到了贝克街，隔着路看着221B熟悉的前门。他很久没来了，但是他的梦从来没怎么离开过这里。他觉得自己像是在告别一样。摆满一桌的实验器材，冰箱里的人体部件，邦德电影马拉松，时不时出现在门口的黑色轿车。 虽然那些东西他早就没有了。 他穿行到另一边，走到门前，他本来想敲敲门进去看一眼，后来改了主意，只是把摆正的门环弄歪了一点，然后离开，没有回头。 他不敢想，如果在以前，在很久、很久以前他鼓起勇气说了出来又会怎样。 也许会有一个Sherlock，有一个John，一直一直留在贝克街221B。一起。 许多无眠的夜之后，他想起了Mycroft说的，关于那个旧号码。留了五年，他总会需要处理一些琐事，比如给手机充电。或许有人帮他做这些也说不定。 Sherlock会说，多愁善感。 John紧紧闭上眼睛。 我爱你。 Sherlock很久之前的墓碑还在，并没有被动过。他也不清楚自己是怎么想的，反正他又去了那儿。他不知道Sherlock事实上埋在哪里，也许在这，也许是别的地方，他不想问。 我爱你。 他盯着黑色大理石上金色的铭文。Sherlock Holmes。 “我爱你。”John悄声说。 他没法再祈求一个奇迹了，那缔造奇迹的天才是听不见的。他爱过的天才只剩掩埋在某处土地下冰冷的尸骸。 半年以后，John鼓起勇气，把那十七封邮件读了，逐字逐句地读了，然后又找出Sherlock以前的邮件。 现在John明白了为什么Sherlock叫他不要回信，为什么Sherlock在邮件里从来只是语焉不详地讲着现状。Sherlock在写给John这些邮件、不厌其烦地编着这些内容的时候，他都在想些什么？ John是没法知道的。他忧伤地想，他永远都没法知道了。 John换了钱包。 他把Sherlock的字条打开。纸已经发黄了，他的手指顺着黑色的字迹走了一圈。关于你的档案完整了。（The file on you is complete.） 他仍把字条放在夹层里，放在Wilda的照片旁边，但再也没有看过。 档案已然封存。 生活总还是要继续的。他去诊所上班，他接送Wilda，他打扫房间，他半夜把电视开成静音。 John知道，慢慢地，他心里那种空落落的痛会一点点减轻。一点一点，他必然会开始不带痛苦不带悔意地想起Sherlock。也许有一天，John在想起他的脸时会露出微笑。他感到罪恶，从某种程度上讲，他甚至不想恢复过来。只是，有一天他会的，无可避免。 然而那不是今天。 他带着恐惧和希望等着那一天的到来。他不知道Sherlock希望他怎样。或许这可以是他——他们——现在能够拥有的最好的结局。 John的枪放在抽屉里，压在Sherlock的旧围巾上。 他已经很久很久没有把枪拿出来过了。但他喜欢把它放在他很容易就能拿到的地方。 四年之后。 “爸爸，这是什么？” John回头，Wilda手里拿着一本表面满是灰尘的书一样的东西。天知道她是在哪里找到的，她最近很喜欢翻东西。她翻开一页，John凑过去看。 是装着他婚礼照片的相册。他告诉了Wilda。John记得当时因为摄影师的问题，即使Sherlock坚持说那里面不会有任何罪证，相机也被当做证物取走了。John弄到那些照片可费了一番周折。他怀疑Sherlock剪辑视频的时候直接黑进了苏格兰场的系统。 Wilda静静地看着照片里的他和Mary。 他在另几张照片里看到了Sherlock。他指给Wilda看，Wilda开心了一点。 “你知道，爸爸，有时候我以为他是你编出来的呢。你说他是你的朋友，我却从来没有见过他。”Wilda仔细地研究着照片里的Sherlock。“真的有一个Sherlock。” “当然！我什么时候骗过你？”John开玩笑地装出一副受伤的样子说。 “在你说可以多给我一点热巧克力的时候！”Wilda咯咯笑道。John不禁跟着她一起笑了起来。 “他当然是真的。”等笑声散去的时候John说。“我大概没告诉过你吧，我们给你起名字的时候就用了他的名字。（I probably haven’t told you we named you after him.）” “那我不应该叫Sherlock Watson吗？”Wilda皱起了眉头。 John张嘴才想解释，突然愣住了。 Sherlock Watson。 脑海中远远地响起Sherlock的声音：我觉得可以啊。（I think it could work.） 那么、那么多他们本来可以拥有却又未曾触及的事物飞速地掠过John的心头：无数种可能性，不变的只有世界唯一的咨询侦探和他的博客写手。也不知道他们是如何成了现在的模样。 或者说，没有人比他更清楚他们是如何成了如今的模样。 John苦笑起来。 唉，Sherlock，你个混蛋。 不管你在哪里，珍重。 （Wherever you are, cheers.） -The End 后记： 很爱的一句歌词译过来是这样的：“我的希望将指引我走过没有你的日子，若是痛苦结束了一切希望，爱会支撑我。” 刚看S3E3结尾的时候，没想到后来有反转，当即被虐趴在那儿。感觉像是他们只剩一句“I love you”没有说出口了。而当侦探说“Sherlock is actually a girl’s name”的时候，我第一反应是：天啊他究竟有多么希望John不要忘记他、有多么希望以最后一种可能的方式留在John的生活里。毕竟时间是真的能冲淡一切的。之后一直在想，如果Sherlock真的一去不回了呢……于是就有了这个折磨了我一年的想法orz期间又因为这个想法攒了不少的脑洞，实在忍不住，一看没有别人写，我就写了…… 其实也是有这么一种情结在。大家都会有太多遗憾，做过的没有办法改变，那就不要后悔，总有一天当初的痛不会再让人感到不甘，带着对往事的温柔走下去，留下一份让人微笑的回忆作纪念，也未尝不可。 以上。 (03.07)之前忘说了，正文最后一句其实是John博客里Many Happy Returns的最后一句，当时就觉得莫名的虐 番外已放出，觉得写这个文简直造孽orz 番外：Underneath Your Ruins/废墟之下 This is my alibi - underneath your ruins I'm buried. Diary of Dreams, Mind over Matter （John昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛，发现天还没亮。 他摇摇头，整了整枕头，重新闭上眼睛。最近的案子算是够Sherlock忙的，还不知道他会不会一时兴起把John拽起床，一起进行一次调查。能睡一会是一会。 他再度沉入梦乡。） Wilda十岁的时候第一次知道Sherlock Holmes已经去世了。那天她翻出了父母结婚的照片，爸爸跟她讲了讲那场婚礼，当然，还有他的伴郎，Sherlock Holmes。想想看，他的婚礼上居然还险些发生一起命案。然后Wilda问爸爸，既然Sherlock是他的伴郎，为什么现在他连个影子都没有。 爸爸沉默了好一会，然后告诉她Sherlock死了。 她很吃惊，当然，也很伤心。爸爸总是会说起他。她一直对爸爸口中这个神秘的侦探很着迷，甚至听说Sherlock拉小提琴之后也磨着爸爸让她去学小提琴（后来她发现一点也不像她想的那么有趣，但她坚持了下来）。她问了为什么，怎么回事，爸爸只是摇头，后来把话题岔开了。 相册里还夹着一个信封，上面写着“To Dr &amp; Mrs Watson”。爸爸说那是Sherlock为他和妈妈谱的曲子。Wilda打开看，默默读着乐谱，没有哼出调来。她隐隐觉得爸爸听了会伤心的。她把乐谱收到自己的房里，想着等什么时候她一个人，她会试着拉一拉琴。 但她还有别的曲子要练。她先把谱子夹在她一本厚些的书里，想着，有时间的。后来她渐渐把这件事忘了。 （John在Tesco一排又一排的货架之间转悠，他没带购物清单，记不起来他本来是想买什么了。 牛奶。肯定有牛奶。Sherlock那懒虫从来记不起这类事，他有时候搪塞John说会买的，但是久而久之John已经不抱希望了，他甚至怀疑Sherlock知不知道Tesco在哪。 但愿冰箱没有还被Sherlock的实验占满。） Wilda十四岁的时候第一次知道爸爸以前有个博客。那天爸爸在学校等她，她新转来的同学的母亲突然发现了什么一样，跟爸爸说起了话。 “我大概在哪里见过您？您是……？” “噢，John Watson。我是个医生。” “我的天啊！您是Sherlock Holmes的那个朋友，对不对？真的没想到！很久之前我还是您博客的忠实读者呢，Dr Watson。只是后来就没有更新过了，发生了什么？我想——” 爸爸显得很不舒服，找了个借口迅速地带着Wilda离开了。“你还有个博客？”路上Wilda问道。 “那是很久以前了。”爸爸叹了口气，接着就没再说什么。Wilda很好奇，但是管住了自己的嘴。她知道就算她问下去爸爸也不会再多说什么了。回家她上网查了一下，用了三天，找空闲时间看完了内容。她从中认出了一些她从前听过的故事，只不过这里的更简略一点，也有一些她之前不知道的部分。 她读了Sherlock的评论，还顺着找到了Sherlock的旧网站。她第一次在爸爸零零散散的的叙述之外了解到跟这侦探有关的东西，这感觉很奇怪。当然，她没有告诉爸爸。 （茶。John伸了个懒腰，揉揉眼睛，烧起了水，随手泡了两杯，按他们两个喜欢的方式。Sherlock倒是没有什么动静，也许是在睡觉，那么这杯茶大概是白泡了。不过没准他只是躲在自己的房间里，不知道什么时候就会出来。也许只裹一条床单。 John偶尔会笑他太懒，但John其实喜欢Sherlock这样。当然这点他绝对不会承认的。） Wilda二十三岁的时候第一次听到了完整的故事。那天她去看爸爸。她已经搬了出去，自己租了一所公寓。她看爸爸一个人，觉得心里不是滋味。她对于未曾谋面的母亲并没有什么执念——Mary无疑是存在过，可Wilda完全记不起她了——于是她说：“你知道，你该找个伴儿的。不知道怎么，我从来没见你约过会什么的。” 爸爸笑了。“就算我魅力四射，现在也已经不是时候了吧。没有这个必要。” “我说真的。什么时候都不晚。” “我也说真的。没有必要。” “你真的不会觉得太闲了？不会孤单？” “是你狠下心来抛弃我的，姑娘。”爸爸揶揄道。“真的，没事，刚退休的时候还有点不适应，现在我也习惯了。有时间看看书什么的。” 然而当天晚上，他们一起坐在沙发上看着电视的时候，爸爸跟她讲了故事的全部，从他跟Sherlock Holmes的相识，他们合租公寓的日子，形形色色的案子，Sherlock离开的三年，Wilda的母亲，Sherlock回来之后，婚礼，以及……结局。Sherlock去了东欧没再回来过，爸爸后来才得知他死了。整个过程中John都盯着前方没有移开目光。 尽管难以置信，Wilda知道爸爸没有说谎的必要。她不知道该对她的母亲作何感想。她也一样不知道该对Sherlock付出了昂贵代价来保护他们的事实作何感想。 后来他们像什么也没发生一样道了晚安。此后一段时间Wilda没再跟John谈过这件事，John也没再怎么跟她提起过Sherlock。 Wilda之后回想的时候才开始问自己，是什么让John想把这事讲给她。 （“噢！所以你的父亲是那个John Watson，真没想到——不知道他跟Sherlock Holmes有没有过……？天啊，我在问什么，真对不起。请当我什么也没说，Wilda。真抱歉。” “没关系。” 这样的对话尽管不频繁，不过已经发生了不止一两次。这些年一直会有人问Wilda这样的事。她之前不是没有好奇过，毕竟她读了博客跟网站上那些近乎老夫老妻吵嘴一般的对话，但是还是否决了这个想法。爸爸毕竟都结婚了，还有了她，如果他们之间真有这层关系——哪有谁会这么傻？谁会甘做自己心上人婚礼的伴郎？ 但现在她没有那么确定了。） John拎着购物袋走到221B门口，发现门环被摆正了。他把它弄歪一点，然后掏出钥匙打算开门，却突然发现钥匙不对。哪一把钥匙都不对。他开始惊慌起来——Mrs Hudson如果换锁，总不可能不告诉他一声的啊？困惑中他按响了门铃，来开门的是个他完全不认识的小伙子。 “您是……？”年轻人礼貌地问道。 “我……Mrs Hudson去哪了？” “抱歉，她去世很久了。” John完全不知道出了什么事。如果这又是Sherlock搞的把戏……可是不对。年轻人身后门厅里的壁纸样子不对。一旦细看，他发现这个地方他完全不认识。小伙子依旧等着，有点不耐烦了。 “这里……这儿不是贝克街221B吗？” “是啊。您是想找谁？” “我……上帝。Sherlock在哪？” “谁是Sherlock？”年轻人皱起了眉头。 “Sherlock。Sherlock Holmes。那个侦探。” “对不起，我不清楚您在说什么。”年轻人摇了摇头。“您或许知道——”就在这时John的手机响了。John掏出手机。是Wilda。 他突然意识到有什么不对了。非常、非常的不对。 “对不起，我应该是弄错了。”John木然地说着，然后转身离开了。走了两三码他才想起来接电话。 “这么久才接？在忙什么？”听筒里传来Wilda欢快的声音。他不知道怎么回答。我去了我以前住的地方。我以为我还住在这里。我忘了Sherlock已经死了二十多年。当Wilda焦急地不住问他出了什么事，他才一下醒过神来。 “我想我需要去一趟医院。”John觉得自己的声音响在很遥远的地方。 Wilda二十七岁的时候爸爸被确诊为阿兹海默症。那天医生告诉她，爸爸的病情恶化只不过是时间问题。她责怪自己对爸爸关心得太少，之前的种种症状他们都忽略了，Wilda不在他身边留意这些事，而爸爸他……他自己大概没意识到。爸爸得知诊断之后把脸埋在双手中，一言不发。 她搬到爸爸那里，辞了现在的职务，找了一份可以在家办公的工作。她有能力雇一个护工，但她不愿意。 她对公寓进行了搜查，把危险品收好，她记得爸爸有一把枪，她翻得很细，但最终没有找到，只好作罢。 爸爸忘记得越来越多。他变得暴躁，又像个小孩子一样情绪化，常常为一点小事大动肝火。他常常混淆时间与记忆，就算在那种时候他一直能勉强认出Wilda，却一口咬定自己并不在家。他应该在肯特。他应该在阿富汗。他应该在帕特尼。他应该在贝克街。贝克街。贝克街。Sherlock在哪里？是在苏格兰场吗？我给他发短信了他一直没有回。他一个人的话不会有人提醒他吃点什么的。 Wilda有时候几乎想摔门把自己锁在自己的房间里揪自己的头发，她几乎难以忍受看自己的父亲变成这副模样。这很痛。很痛。开始她还会告诉他Sherlock已经不在了，看了爸爸之后消沉的样子，过了一周她放弃了。每天为了安抚神志不清的爸爸她会说各种各样的谎。他出去了，爸爸。他去了巴茨的实验室。他出去打算买些什么。他一定是太忙了。 之后她想方设法，真的租下了221B。Mrs Hudson早已去世，如今房东大约是她某个亲戚，跟她差不多年纪，名叫Larry。劝服他和现在的租客花了一周时间。然后她开始联系爸爸以前认识的那些人，Greg Lestrade，Molly Hooper，甚至还有成立过空灵车的Anderson，尽可能收集信息，希望大概了解一下221B从前的布局是什么样子。 然后Mycroft Holmes联系了她。电话另一端的声音油滑之中带着礼貌的疏远。她把爸爸托付给邻居。去跟Mycroft见面的时候她很不安，她没有去联系Mycroft是有原因的，尽管她得知了Mycroft收着Sherlock所有的东西。谁能坦然看待自己弟弟的死呢？ 她到了约定地点（一所空房子），见到的是一个老人，但他目光的锐利还未曾因时光和衰老消失。他打量着她，Wilda顿时有种被人看透的不悦感觉。也许Sherlock的眼神跟他会是一样的。 “我相信我们可以跳过寒暄的部分。”他慢慢地说。 “当然。” “那么我就开门见山了。你租下了贝克街221B，打算带着你的父亲搬过去。” “是的。”她犹豫了一下。“我想尽可能恢复它从前的样子。我父亲他……你应该知道。我只是想让他好受一些。” Mycroft挑起眉毛。“你都知道了。” Wilda知道他指的是什么，或者说她以为她知道他指的是什么。她点点头。 Mycroft不带感情地笑了一下。“很好。事情是这样，Miss Watson，我保留着我弟弟的所有东西，还有从前那间公寓的一些录像。我可以把它们给你。” 说真的，录像？Wilda忍住没有哼一声。她听得出Mycroft未曾出口但是悬在话音中的某种要求，但是Mycroft接下来没有说话。 “用来交换什么？（In exchange of what？）”她问。 “你的确很像你父亲。” Wilda的头抬高了一点，期待着挑衅。“对此我很庆幸。（Of which I’m glad.）” “Sherlock应该会喜欢你的。可惜他给自己找了个借口一劳永逸地逃了。”Mycroft轻笑着摇了摇头，沉默了一会。逃避什么？她没有问。她觉得自己知道答案。Wilda耐心地等着Mycroft继续，她有的是耐心。最终Mycroft开腔了。 “你会拉小提琴，Miss Watson。” “这两年有些疏于练习。”因为爸爸。“不过是的。” “Sherlock有一把Stradivarius，他离开的时候带在了身边，后来便回到了我手里。”Mycroft低下头。“我并不会这种乐器，留着它是种痛苦。当然，我有定期找人护理它。其他的东西我可以明天找人送到你那里去，然而这把琴并不是我愿意轻易送出的东西。我有条件。” 你也不是不能留着它，Wilda想说，但是管住了嘴。不同的情绪在她心里交战。她讨厌这种处境，然而那是Stradivarius，而且从某种意义上讲，这把琴是她学了小提琴的全部原因，就算能见一见它也好。 “我希望你能为我演奏一曲，Miss Watson，然后它就是你的了。” Wilda突然为这个素昧平生的男人感到心酸。她同意了。出于对这把琴的尊重，最终碰它之前她练习了两个月。 搬家的时候她找到了Sherlock为她父母写的华尔兹。她把乐谱收好。最后她给Mycroft拉的并不是这支曲子，它属于爸爸。 搬到221B那天，爸爸惊讶地环视着屋子，眼睛里蒙上一层水光。他紧紧抱着Wilda，哽咽着轻轻耳语道：“噢，Willie，谢谢，亲爱的。谢谢你。” 至少爸爸不清醒的时候不再抱怨他不在贝克街了。Wilda把打理干净的Sherlock的东西到处摆了些，只是易碎的还留在箱子里收着。头骨，文件，书籍，多到荒唐的打印机。她在门后挂了一件Sherlock的大衣（拆箱的时候她发现大衣里还包着一件很旧很丑的套头毛衣），她把Sherlock的旧档案堆在桌子上，她在新贴的墙纸上用黄色颜料画了个笑脸。爸爸睡在Sherlock以前的卧室里，他的腿脚已经不方便他经常上下楼梯了。Wilda用着楼上的卧室。 爸爸逐渐只能撑在助步器上在客厅里蹒跚。他每一天里会清醒上两三个小时，后来连这时间也渐渐缩短，其余的时候他要么胡言乱语抱怨着Sherlock，要么沉陷在另一个世界里缄口不语。换个角度想，一天里大多数时间他都意识不到Sherlock已经死了。Wilda慢慢习惯了看见他呆滞而发散的目光。 或者，谁也不会真的习惯这种事，她只是疲惫到再也不去细想了。 一天，爸爸窝在轮椅上，哀伤地看着她为了他忙里忙外。“我很抱歉。”他小声说。 Wilda的心猛地沉了一下，但她故作轻松地问：“为什么？（What for?）” 爸爸叹了口气。“你的大好时光就这么荒废了，照顾一个糊里糊涂的老头子。忙一忙事业，谈谈恋爱——什么都比这要好得多。” “无聊。”Wilda勉强让自己的声音保持平和。 “你这样听着真的很像他，你知道。”爸爸苦笑着。“我也没早点发现自己出了问题。根本意识不到。这些年我已经太习惯他占满我的脑袋了……”他的声音弱了下去。 你爱他吗，爸爸？Wilda当时几乎就问出了口，但当她转身面对他的时候，他的意识已经再次坠入迷雾。 （John醒了。晨光从窗帘的缝隙钻入房间，Sherlock还在他的臂弯之中，似乎还睡着。John不禁微笑，脸颊贴上Sherlock温暖而柔软的肌肤。他盯着横亘Sherlock肩胛的白色疤痕出神，最终用嘴唇轻轻描摹着那线条，喃喃道：“我爱你。” 他没指望会有回复，所以片刻之后，Sherlock低沉而微微沙哑的声音响起的时候他被惊到了。“我也一样。早上好。”John能听出他在微笑。 “你说什么？”John挑起一条眉毛。 “我说：我也一样。” “混蛋，你醒了有多久？” “我就没睡着。”John能感觉到Sherlock的声音在他胸腔里的振动。Sherlock转过身来，直视着John的眼睛，然后吻了John。 “昨天晚上……”他们断开吻之后，John刚开口，Sherlock就僵住了，John连忙接着说下去：“不，不，我不是那个意思。我没有后悔。我是说，昨晚你说……你说你一早就要离开。” Sherlock放松下来。他沉默了一会，然后说：“我想我改主意了。” “哦？” “去他的任务。我要回伦敦去。” “你是认真的。”John茫然地说。 “没错。我会想点办法。我会的。” “你会的？” “我会的。” John不知道该说什么，他不由自主地咧嘴笑了起来，收也收不住。无疑数不清的麻烦会出现，但现在，现在，此时此刻，他根本在乎不起来。） Wilda二十九岁的时候第一次问了爸爸她一直以来想知道的东西。那天爸爸坐在他的扶手椅里，视而不见地盯着对面的空椅子。一般Wilda在旁边做些什么他一点都不会注意，Wilda时不时地会跟他说些什么，当然，八成时间没有应答。一般在这个时段她在窗边练琴——她自己的琴，Stradivarius一向被小心地放在琴箱里。但是那天她一时兴起，取出了那把Stradivarius，拉起了Sherlock写给爸爸的华尔兹。 献给John和Mary的华尔兹。并不复杂的一支曲子，然而动听。Wilda早已练熟了。她好奇她是否能够循着每一处音符的起落，探回本源，探回那作曲的侦探当时的思绪。 一曲终了。 “我记得这个。”爸爸沙哑的声音响了起来。 她转身，发现爸爸泪流满面。 “我居然让他做了我的伴郎。我……我当时不知道……”爸爸举起一只手捂住了眼睛。 “都过去了，爸爸。都过去了。” “他给我写信，你看，在他离开之后。我去了一次国外，他来找到了我，那天晚上我们……他说会给我写信。之后两个月他写了很多封邮件，系统自动发送给我，一年两封，可他两个月就死了。这傻瓜想让我以为他一直活着。如果那该死的……那该死的……系统……没有出错，我也许永远都不会知道……” “爸爸——” “他就这么一直把我蒙在鼓里！”爸爸自顾自地说了下去。“我……事情本来会不一样的。我本来该做些什么。他不知道。他一直都不知道。我……” Wilda迟疑着，最终还是问了。 “爸爸……你爱他吗？（Did you love him？）” “我……是的。一直都是。（I did.I do.）” （John注视着镜子里映出的墙，上面空无一物的墙。他手边的茶一点点地冷掉。 再过不久，Sherlock就回来了，他会在墙上贴满各种各样的地图、纸片与照片。会有一个Sherlock，有一个John，一直一直留在贝克街221B。一起。） Wilda三十岁的时候第一次在现实中听到枪响。那天她在黎明时分被枪声惊醒，惊恐之中倦意全部消失了。她下意识冲下楼跑到爸爸的房间猛推开门、打开灯，第一眼看到的是墙壁上喷溅的血迹。 爸爸的身体躺在床上，枪握在左手中，另一手攥着一条褪了色的旧围巾。Wilda闭上眼睛。她没有尖叫。没有哭泣。 等她再睁开眼，她看到床头柜上一张纸条，字迹歪歪扭扭，折痕看上去有点旧了。 “原谅我，宝贝。我只是没法这样下去了。” Wilda感到近乎诡异的冷静，她检查了生命体征后机械地转过身去，找到电话报了警。她似乎听见Larry在楼下大呼小叫，听见有人叫她的名字。她回到房间里坐在爸爸身边，手轻轻地覆在他攥着围巾的手上。 “替我跟他问好。（Tell him I said hello.）”Wilda柔声说。 -The End 作者絮叨： 没错我又来废话了…… 其实有这么一种想法：Sherlock三年假死的时候，他活着，他骗所有人说他死掉了，他成了所有人的伤口，John就带着伤痛活下去move on了；假设他死去了，却骗所有人说他活着，那么也许他就像个失联的老朋友淡出了大家的生活，这一次John默默地继续着自己的生活，或许释然，但是像被埋在废墟之下一样再也没有摆脱Sherlock留下的空洞。正文写一样东西怎么碎的，番外写碎片怎么积灰蒙尘却无法凭空消失。 这样可能是让他们最后在一起，而我又能接受得了的唯一方法（真的写什么天堂再相遇或者神奇复活什么的实在做不到orz）。 以上。","categories":[{"name":"BBC

那天清晨，福尔摩斯在他的花园正中吻了我，漫不经心，但一如既往地令人心动。空中羊群般的饱满云朵打我们头顶掠过。之后他把养蜂帽夹在精瘦的胳臂下，大步流星地走去别处，我方才记起这于他而言——正式而言——恰是我们移居苏塞克斯的首要原因，也就是说，让他能够能在光天化日之下公然亲吻我（注）。我的朋友行事鲜少目的单一，但我的确认为苏塞克斯是他最接近于此的决定：一项心无旁骛的计划。我想，若我忘记了我们的小屋是因这特授于我的福祉而存在，也未尝不可原谅，原因有二：其一，无论何时，只要他吻我，就不应指望我能清醒思考什么。其二，那是一九二七年，虽说其间两度间断（注2），但我们已经在此居住了约有二十年。（译注：1.详见系列前篇Birds to a Lighthouse/群鸟飞向灯塔。2.一次指侦探在1912年时在美国、爱尔兰等地调查德国间谍集团，详见原著《最后的致意》；一次指医生在一战时从军，详见系列前篇The Presbury Letters/珀斯博利信件） 我手拿一块布擦着松木餐桌，思索良久。玛莎（注）近日两周才会来清扫一次，毕竟我们无疑已经渐趋于隐居避世。然而，三天之后，当我们踏上去伦敦的旅程，情况将有变动。我开始回想旧日往事，因为我正处于一则短篇故事的写作之中。实不相瞒这故事糟糕透顶，一经我之手已不堪入目、杂乱无章，我认定是我的记忆力出了问题。于是我仅仅是手拿一块蓝色亚麻布，站在一尘不染的狭小厨房里回忆往昔。（译注：在《最后的致意》中提及的仆人） 例如，我想起我们是在黑夜渐长的九月，携大包小裹初至此地。当时福尔摩斯才五十一岁，就我如今的标准而言，算是十分年轻了。他的头发有些地方乌黑依旧，事实上若不算他银灰的鬓角，还有四分之三的黑发。而除却他右手在左臂上刺下的千余细密针痕，他轻盈柔韧的优美身躯多多少少尚可算作无暇。那是在轰炸的烟云（注）之前，我们预料之外的战争还未曾无端而至、将世界尽数蹂躏。（译注：系列前篇The Presbury Letters/珀斯博利信件中的情节，德军轰炸伦敦） 我的朋友注视着屋舍，头一偏，露出微笑。那种奇异怪诞的笑，情不自禁，而他往往毫无自觉。我几近难以启齿去承认他这不知不觉的微笑触动我程度之深。我对之心怀敬慕，如同向圣迹顶礼膜拜的朝觐者。 “你觉得怎么样？” 说来我们碰巧处于一次甚为激烈的争吵中。此前一个月的某日下午，他迈进客厅宣布我们即将搬去苏塞克斯，让我尽快收拾行装。我回应说，他可真是以为我会抛下一切，离开我们二人深爱的城市，再搬进一处我从未踏足的住所？是的，他说，还有别忘了买些更轻便的夏装。此举虽是意料之内，依旧足以令人大为光火，事实上，恰恰因此反而更难让人原谅。因此，我任凭旅途中一切潜在的恼人琐事把我惹怒，其实我已经至少一小时没有对他开口了。 可接着……接着我看到了那所房子。 小屋处于伊斯特本北部边界，距海和岸边白垩质的峭壁有一英里，在一条草木丛生、蜿蜒起伏于乡间的小路旁侧。房子离这路很远，被白榆丛环绕，粉成蓝色，两层高，虽说顶层除我们文件堆积如山的办公室之外基本是杂物间。房前有一门廊，房后也一样，并且，由于当时正值九月，两边均设有桌椅。一大片黄色百叶蔷薇几乎完全把游廊掩去，延伸至人们行车必经的尘土小径。每扇窗顶都饰有红黄的方形彩色玻璃。我们头顶的树叶中除了绿色的，不是透红便是正在转黄。 我忘记了我的怒气。 “我们要住在这儿？”我像个孩子般屏息惊叹。 我自余光瞥见福尔摩斯歪头大笑。在那时，若非凭此，我根本不会知道他笑了（注）。（译注：当时侦探大笑起来是没有笑声的，详见系列前篇The Presbury Letters/珀斯博利信件） “你希望这是我初次所见。”我沉吟道。“到现在你让我生了你四周的气，就为了不破坏一个惊喜。” “如果你心存歉疚，你可以补偿我，”他打趣道。“我不介意。” 我也不介意，恐怕我从未介意过。我们的行李一进门，新门经检验锁匙相合，我当即对他做出弥补，跪在他身前，另种形式的锁匙便合榫相接。我猜这出乎他意料。我紧贴着他下腹的肌肉，透过那传来的微小颤动感受到他再度发笑，毕竟如我所言，当时我难得一闻他大笑出声，但一切完美无缺。所有一切。我心想，我们在这里会幸福的。我怎该怀疑他哪怕一次？当我这样跪在他面前，他会用拇指描摹着我的眉， 正如他此时所做的那样。 那是许久之前了，我提醒自己。很久之前。与所有案件完全无关。之后是什么？ “蜜蜂。”三个月后他对我说，并把一本手册丢在我的写字台上。我正在此写着一个故事——也是个不错的故事，相当不错，引人入胜——而此时正值严冬。 “不可以。”我说。 “可以的。”他说着，面容生光。“我一定要养蜂。蜜蜂是如此迷人，华生。你知道它们借一种复杂的舞蹈来交流花蜜的方位吗？” “不可以。我也不知道。”我补充道，抬起头来，故作平和地向他微笑。 “我会为你酿制甜蜜。”他说，刻意使每一个字眼听上去有伤风化。 “很诱人。”我承认道，因为确实如此。他同时决定现在坐在我大腿上时机刚好，右手颀长的五指沿着我的脸颊和下颌落在不同的几处，这相当令人分神。 “我自己也会享用的。”他采取了远更高明的策略，提议道。 次年春天我们养了蜜蜂。如今我喜欢上它们了。福尔摩斯像对待他捉摸不透的事物那般爱着蜜蜂。对太多事物知之甚详必定是种诅咒。我花了一段时间才了解他这一点，发现他爱我的部分原因在于我令他全无头绪。我自认平淡无奇。我的动机向来清晰，不难推测，而我惯常不进行毫无目的之举。我并非善变无常，这偶尔会令我困惑，为什么福尔摩斯看着我时会像是在检视令他心醉的谋杀现场一般。但如果我能使他迷惑，那么上帝保佑他，我随他怎样均可，蜜蜂亦同。而自蜂房产下的蜂蜜确实醇美新鲜，我很高兴我们买了第一巢蜜蜂。 但这已经是那么久之前了。我的头脑不休地敦促我记起当前更为重要的事，尽管我倾尽所能地与之对抗。 我还是败下阵来，于是我想起今天上午。我不愿这样，但还是想了起来。我想起了上午十点半。 当时我穿过餐室打算泡壶茶，正读着一篇不错的文章，心满意足，怡然自得。随后我隐隐听见脚步声响，透过一扇窗看见福尔摩斯朝家门奔来，是轻快的短跑，是他为讲求效率而非事态紧急时的大步飞奔，但无论如何我还是提心吊胆起来。我本不应如此，因为我见他这样奔跑已不下千次。那明显代表着事态无关紧要，但依然令我情难自禁。他穿入后门，进门时我看见了疼痛在他鼻梁上印下的细微纹路。 “你还好吗？”我质问道。 “是的，当然。” 福尔摩斯走向水池，打开水龙头，完全镇定自若。不过他一贯如此。歇洛克輠尔摩斯曾几度在我面前命悬一线，却表现得泰然自若。 “见鬼去吧，到底怎么回事？”我厉声道。 我的朋友仅是僵了片刻，然后转过身来与我对视。 “一般我对蜂蜇并不介意。”他拖长腔调。“可这一蛰恰恰叮在我左手食指的第二指节，如果我不快把蛰针拔出，等我拉起琴来将麻烦至极。医生，”他叹道。 “当然，让我来帮你。”我提议，已然为自己的举动羞愧不堪。 我上前去与他一同站在水池边，遗憾的是，此处光线更佳。并不是说福尔摩斯需要光亮才能对我的思绪了如指掌，恰恰相反，我曾被他振振有词地告知，即使我不在他视线之内，他照样能知悉我的心思。此时蛰伤无疑已被他抛到九霄云外，他挑起我的下巴以看清我的脸，触在我皮肤上的手指冰冷潮湿。 “你以后是要一直这样……”他的另一只手在半空中一挥，优雅地一晃。“永远如此？不论我是修剪花草时擦破了指节，头疼，或是说，举个时有发生的例子，浑身都痛？” “我会尽量避免。”我起誓说。“我保证。” 我摇摇头，把那情景驱出脑海，再次拂拭光洁的桌面，盯着潮迹蒸散。但我的思绪无休止地盘旋而下，沉入我最不愿细思之事。 我自觉愚蠢迟钝，像个年老无用的傻瓜。 我坐了下来。 实际上，不妨说近来我似乎频频如此沉沦。 到一九二七年，我们经受了两次心脏病突发，而我毫无理由对其中任一次感到意外。“我们”意指福尔摩斯，虽说其中疼痛钻心、牙关紧咬、剧烈气喘的每一刻我都感同身受。我七十五岁，而他小我两岁，同样步入迟暮。这个终生积习难改的瘾君子首次自尝恶果，竟会令我感到讶异，我确实不解自己为何会大惊小怪，但我仍然大受打击。随后我们贮存了充足的硝酸甘油，有备无患。第二次过后有整整四天我魂不守舍，完全惊慌失措。这四天刚刚结束，我竭尽全力仍是难以自持。 在上一周我救他一命之后，他恳切地向我道歉，然后便陷入沉思。 “我不是有意要让你经受这种折磨的。”他轻声说。 “你从来不是有意让我经受任何折磨。” 我合上医疗箱，叩击之声响彻狭小的房间。那声音言说着我永远不会对他开口言说之事，言说着：你曾给过我地狱般的折磨，而的确——你从非有意如此。我不会费神去思索若是他蓄意伤害我是否会好些，因为他从未这样做过，也永远不会这么做。即便他给我无尽的伤痛，我仍深知这一点，而这是我不仅容忍他、更无法忍受失去他的万千理由之一。若他能够转变自身秉性，直至永不会再伤害我，即使那是世间最骇人的痛苦之举，他付诸行动绝不会有片刻犹豫。这是我所归结出关于他的、更加令人心折的事实之一。 “你总要发觉，这向来不是我身上最优之处。”他柔声自白道，身穿衬衫盘腿坐于我们的床上，盯向窗外，甚至与平日的他自己相比都显得异常苍白。 吞下巨石般梗在我喉中的硬结，我转过身去。 “你是说你的心？” 他耸耸肩，点了一下头。 “你这固步自封、顽固不化、妄自尊大、愚昧无知的混蛋。”我低吼。“那我可想知道你自认最优的特质是什么。” “我不知道。”他试探地露出一丝小小的微笑。“我的双手从前还不错。依我看来，约翰，愚昧无知可就有些言过其实了，不是吗？” 于是我吻了他。我吻着他，因为他有朝一日终将死去，却全然不知他的心是我今生所遇最优美绝伦的一颗。我曾以为总有一天他会懂得这一点，但他无法明白。如果我约莫四十年的爱恋都没有起效，我不知道还有什么可以。我已竭尽全力。 福尔摩斯走了进来，发现我正盯着一卷未完成的手稿、一张光洁无尘的餐桌、一块蓝布以及我的手指出神。诚然，这在我们家中绝非惯常之景。 “好吧，有话直说。”他说道，坐在我面前的桌上，修长的双腿在胫骨处交叠。 “你健谈起来还真是迷人。”我略有偏颇地回敬。“我无法把这个故事的情节连缀起来。既不是其原本始末，也仍未与现实背道而驰。” “那你为什么要写？” “请原谅，你说什么？” 我朋友浅淡弯曲的眉向我质询般地一挑。“若你既不乐于写作，也不能从其阅读中得到愉悦，你也不需要藉此赚钱，那你为什么要写？我恰巧知道你不需要这钱，我们手头尚算阔绰，你的抚恤金又多得荒唐。” 我知道自己不顾上述因素进行写作的原因为何。他完全没有错，但问题的答案与他无关。而福尔摩斯，上帝保佑他，他总是倾向于完全出于意外地弄清与他毫无干系的事情。于是我为自己争取了些时间。 “我心情很不好。”我承认着，把纸页推开。“自打我上次重返伦敦已经太久了——多久，如今有两年了？——而我想我在怕自己会认不出它来，或者认不出……任何人，那些除了雷斯垂德以外多年的旧相识。或许我怕自己完全失去了与人交往的诀窍。” “要完全重建伦敦所需不止两年。”我的朋友温和地回答。“而若真有这么一天你失去了与人类往来的诀窍，上主垂怜，那是因为你与人类种族中一个极其无可救药的范本同住。” “那个人还不错。”我摆弄了一会他的手指，这是个我未曾厌倦分毫的习惯。“你在做什么？” “我任你支配。我有四封信要写，但可以等等。” 他向下探出闲着的手，指尖掠过我的后颈。不幸的是，尽管他的抚摸对我的触动并无消减，这并不能说是我当时想要的，确切而言这四天里皆是如此。这对我们来讲并不正常，但我相信，目前为止我的兴味索然还能显得合乎情理。一次我仅仅是睡着了，而他蜷在炉火前的椅中直至深夜。一次我们就寝后，我设法紧偎在他身边，这般舒适安宁、心满意足，最终相安无事。一次正当慵懒的下午，我佯作文思泉涌，当即换得了他礼貌的回避。 “我们要到镇上去。”我说道，捉住他的手匆匆印下一吻。 “是吗？我能否问问为什么？” “我们已经几周没有充当罪案侦缉人员了。有各种不能开口询问任何人的事需要我们知道。比方说，费尔法克斯太太的孙女出生了没有？布朗先生究竟是卖掉了他的西南牧场，还是同以往一样在最后关头变了卦，因为他最好的牧羊犬碰巧埋在那里？杜布瓦夫人当真打算把她发疯的外甥安置在这儿消夏吗？” “而这些要事得由我推理出来，我猜想？” “我得见见光。”我再次把那些该死的手稿推开。“我想，来点人声，再喝个两三杯，然后我就能恢复正常。” “那么我们走着去。”他耸耸肩。“不过要是乔治·哈弗山姆在任何可见的地方，我会拒绝坐进狮与雄鹿酒馆。只要看见他，我就离开。如果我没看见他，但他在场而且感觉得到他的存在，我会离开。如果能凭逻辑推断出他即将到来，我也要离开。” 在写下一系列脍炙人口的短篇故事之时，有些后果我未能预见，时至一九二七年，其中之一似乎已能成为定论。比如，歇洛克·福尔摩斯不论行至何处，甚至苏塞克斯，都难免要遇见……我不太清楚怎样称呼这些人为好，或许该说是“仰慕者”，虽说他们中谁都不曾与他有过私交。“迷恋者”或许更为合适。 所幸，在我们当地的酒馆，此等人物只有一位，名叫乔治·哈弗山姆。福尔摩斯曾遭逢一场长达一小时的争论，事关格里姆斯比·罗伊洛特医生所养的蛇究竟是哪一品种。（注）其间，我朋友的这位盘问者严肃至极地告诉他，沼地蝰蛇纯属子虚乌有。这样的谬误是我的过错，当然，有时是刻意为之，有时则出于疏忽。当时福尔摩斯对此事的容忍，完全缘于他余光里见我忍俊不禁。结果他极尽骇人听闻之能事，谎称有印度秘士曾培育出现代科学无从探知的生物，使我更加捧腹不止。第二次，我的朋友小口正啜饮着黑啤，哈弗山姆热衷地旁敲侧击，想要得知他与艾琳·艾德勒之间的关系是否另有隐情。（注2）福尔摩斯彬彬有礼地请求他——我在此引用——“鉴于我应隔壁的彼得斯先生所求要对酒保严加监测，以确保他的威士忌能倒足分量，请求你滚蛋是否会使你过于为难？”（译注：1.出自《斑点带子案》。2.出自《波西米亚丑闻》） “乔治·哈弗山姆除了你的尊敬之外别无所求。”我揶揄道。 “还有我的时间，多至荒唐的时间。噢，还有我全部的私人秘史，一旦细想，很可能还有我的毛囊。这人是个疯子。” “你可是独一无二的。”我假作同情。“他发现世间奇人恰恰就在他所住的小村庄。他或许有幸一睹真容，可一旦有过一次邂逅，要想让这可怜人自此克制自己——” “你终于精神失常了，我想。真可惜距离婚礼（注）只剩那么几天，你还一直如此满怀期待。”（译注：指侦探和医生即将到伦敦参加的一场婚礼，详见下文） “那可没有乔治哈弗山姆对于能隐隐瞥见某人的鹰钩鼻那么满怀期待。” “再说下去我就跟他说你保守了不少阴暗的秘密，叫他务必用一份牧羊人派（注）从你这里一一套出。”（译注：英国传统料理，用土豆、肉类和蔬菜做的不含面粉的派） 狮与雄鹿酒馆的牧羊人派难以下咽的程度仅次于我在大战期间的补给。我情不自禁，向他咧嘴而笑。福尔摩斯拿起我手稿中的一页眯眼读起来。他从他象牙色的外衣衣袋中抽出他的眼镜，推上鼻梁，微皱的眉头当即舒展开来。 “世人敬慕你。”我归结道。 “唔，读着这个，我想我还是可以理解为何我会如此受人欢迎。我是说，慧眼稀缺，庸人横行。不过即使公众没能慧眼识珠，华而不实的惊险文学总能使人热血沸腾。那么，我们出发吧。”他说，轻轻把那一页纸放下。“我真不敢设想‘福尔摩斯将刀没柄捅入尸体，敏锐的灰眼中光芒闪烁’后面要接出什么内容来。” “你确实是这么做的。”我指出。“我就在那，眼见你的一举一动。” “你当然在场。”他赞同，倾下身来吻我，简短，干燥，而又美妙。“我只不过无法明白为什么他人亦需身临其境。拿上你的手杖，但凡姓哈弗山姆的人从不在五点前喝酒，所以我们能够抢占先机。” 而当然，我没能回答他不曾明说的问题。彼时我觉得自己做不到，也永远做不到。歇洛克輠尔摩斯恣意而为而我却希望他戒绝的行为多不胜数，他对我那些最为严重而又最难于发觉的弱点直中要害的习惯碰巧是其中之一。于是我等待着适当的时机，等他生生撕扯出我内心的一部分并展示给我看——当然，他完全是出于意外——而去取我的帽子和手杖。 事实上，我们在狮与雄鹿度过的时光十分愉快——当我对福尔摩斯有所期许时他向来能够令人倾倒，乔治·哈弗山姆也无迹可寻。在我们回家享用面包、奶酪、蜂蜜以及福尔摩斯在园子里新收的豌豆前，约有三个小时，我忘记了自己的忧愁。总之，当日下午的时光太过怡人，随后发生的一切才如此猝不及防。我本应对这场不断迫近的对峙有所预期，但老实讲，我没有。我并不愚蠢，在世间万千能与之并肩而立以供比对的人之中，福尔摩斯会第一个表示认同。然而，我可能会毫无必要地乐观过头，这回恰是如此。 简言之——否则我难以忍受忆及此事——我们准备就寝。我阅读了半个小时，与此同时福尔摩斯写好了他提到过的信件。我们熄了灯。爬上了床，我们一如以往靠向彼此身边，我朋友的手隐隐向下探去，探向一处正有四天不曾受他光顾的地方。 我僵住了，对于可能的后果无比惊慌。上天助我。言语的空缺可曾抵挡得住歇洛克·福尔摩斯？ “究竟怎么了？”他急切地询问。 “没什么。”我连忙说。“我有点累了。” “你没有。” 他的回驳完全属实，于是我祈祷这一次——哪怕就这一次——我的思维能敏捷到先他一步。我倒不如祈求能飞起来。 “我的——” “腿并不难受，肩膀并不难受，手也并不难受。”他迅速插话。“我到底该死地干了什么？尽早一吐为快，这样我或许能得体致歉然后回归正题——” “这不……严格来讲并不安全。”我脱口而出。 福尔摩斯转身把电灯打开。我的朋友认为科技造福人类，我也一样，虽说有时我会思念煤气灯摇曳不定的光亮，正如我思念其他许多事物一样。 福尔摩斯向后蹲坐而起，上身诱人地一丝不挂。他精瘦的体格从未失却唤起我最原始欲望的能力。他利刃般的目光投向我。我不会在此种行为面前畏缩，但我深知出现这种情况时要小心行事。 “安全。”他重复着。“你是说这样一种活动——我们已纵情享受了有多少次，约翰？成千上万？你有计过次数吗？因为我数不过来了——” 我默不作声。 “——不安全。”他挖苦地作结。“敬请向我指明个中缘由。” 以名誉担保，我苦苦思索着如何作答，我思索着这对于我，对于他，对于我们将意味着什么。我几乎把一切因果次序翻来覆去——当然，除去我刻意忽视的可能结果。最终，我决定，既然我无论如何骗不过他，尝试也是徒劳无功。 “你身体还没完全恢复。”我回答。 福尔摩斯，上帝保佑他，后缩了至少整整一英寸。我此生大概有三次见证过他这副模样，而且从来不是在面对沼地蝰蛇（注）、恶魔猎犬（注2）或是手持凶器蓄势待发的罪犯之时，而是我恶语伤人之时。我这种使他心生恐惧比对生命威胁更甚的能力，并不使我引以为傲。数次达成此种效果并不使我引以为傲。任一次的每分每秒，除去我彼时彼刻完全是在采取我认为最合适的行动这一事实，都并不使我引以为傲。要与一个毋庸置疑时刻占着上风的人同居绝非易事，何况我还是有着意志和脾气的，也不是说他有过刻意要操纵我的时候——只不过我存在于一个比他滞后大概五分钟的时间体系之中，日日如此。而我们所作所为中的间隙无可避免地要导致我犯下可悲的错误。出错确在意料之中，但得知我对他的伤害远超出他人所能，包括刻意为之者，并且屡次如此，是十分痛苦的。如果我为人宽厚，我会原谅自己的行为。但当罪行足够深笃时，我并不宽容。（译注：1.同前文，出自《斑点带子》。2.出自《巴斯克维尔的猎犬》。） “让我理个清楚，”福尔摩斯的声音变得冷硬如钢。“我正为一项引致恶果的陋习付出代价。而为偿付这些肉体上的恶果，我将继续以一系列全然不同的肉体上的恶果为代价。因为你觉得，每当我该死的肩膀抽动一下我都要眼见你血色尽失时，我消受的折磨还不够多。左肩，因而与你显然心中所想的某个器官在同一区域。这还远远不够，你想扳回一局。” 我唇焦口燥。“看在上帝份上，歇洛克——” “不，我看得出来这对你来说还不够。我能否提议采用另一种惩罚，或许，再一次——” “简直一派胡言。你心知肚明，我是想保护你，而不是惩罚你。” “那你可真是相当精于此道啊。”他厉声回击。 “我无法为想要延长你的生命道歉。” 所有的愤怒连同一切受伤的隐痛，顷刻之间藏得无影无踪。见此，我凭着经验对即将发生之事颇感忧虑。对我而言，这意味着前景不妙，向来如此。事实上，这是史上最为可怕的征兆。福尔摩斯起身站在床边，向下瞪着我，用手掌把头发向后捋顺，好显得郑重其事，以做出我预想着要到来的某种宣告。 “那么，我要离婚。”他和颜悦色地说。（注）（译注：当时没有同性婚姻，不过这里的侦探和医生很久之前便当做他们结了婚，详见系列前篇Hallowed Be Thy Name/尊汝名为圣 和Birds to a Lighthouse/群鸟飞向灯塔） 恐怕我有好一段时间哑口无言。 “你……你怎么？”我终于勉强结结巴巴说出了口。 “离婚，鉴于你拒绝我行使婚权。” “可我——我是说，我只是——” “或者基于你拒不履行婚誓。” “我们什么誓约都没立过，歇洛克·福尔摩斯。” “无稽之谈。每一天都是一次誓约。不列颠陪审团会立即准许我的请愿。” “你没法让这事呈堂审理！”我抗议道，无助地摊开双手。 “那好，那就拿张纸写下来，我会签名确认。另外，我要搬走。” “你要搬哪儿去？” 事态急转直下，可怕得让我都难以思考，呼吸失调。可能事后想来这件事本该引人发笑，实际却有如噩梦。福尔摩斯从椅背上抽起一条毯子搭过肩头，拽走了床那边他的枕头。他从床头柜上拿起他的书、他的眼镜，然后直起高挑瘦削的身体，除去单薄的亚麻系带睡裤之外未着一物，站在我们卧室门口。 “搬不远。这毕竟还是我的财产。等你拿来相应的文件，我将十分乐意签下大名。晚安，华生。” 过了几分钟我才恢复镇静，想出对策去追赶他。因为当歇洛克·福尔摩斯处于这种特定的状态，毫无对策便横冲直撞实属下策。我坐在那里思考，抗击着天旋地转之感，最终达成数个结论。恐怕其中没有一个稍遂人意，而我近来这般畏首畏尾恐怕也是太多了。深吸几口气，我披上一件轻薄的睡袍出去探探风声。 他不在厨房。我快跑上楼，猜想他在办公室，但他也不在那。他不在客厅，不在与之相连的正式餐厅。去年那里举行了杰弗里雷斯垂德七十五岁的生日庆典，三人参加，时长八小时，直至凌晨四点才告罄。我去了屋外。 福尔摩斯在屋外地界正中，毯子铺展在花园旁柔软的草坪上，面带一种愠怒的沉静仰视着群星。我举着灯走近，低头望着他。 “你光临我的新居究竟有何贵干？”他冷冰冰地问。 “我能进来吗？” 他耸耸肩，而要想保持卧姿还把这动作做得优雅可不容易。我把灯安放在地面上，踏上毯子。我们均是赤脚。我向后躺下，注视起他正遥望着的星辰。 “这或许是我不幸的缺点，”我略为不稳地开口。“我常将超出我所知范围的责任强加于己，进而包揽常人望而却步的事项。从你的生活中剔除甚多威胁向来是其中之一，没错，尽管难比登天，我还是就此取得了可观成效。可有时，当我尝试做一件棘手的事，我不会深思熟虑。刚刚我就没有深思熟虑。我……我渴望你仍同以往一般深切，但我在怕。这一周我想自控却都是无能为力。我向你起誓，我会尽全力避免使你余生被束缚在一个懦夫身边。求你原谅我。” 我的朋友长叹一声，一只优美的手揉起脸来。他躯干之上星罗棋布的疤痕在月光之下白得突兀，如同蛛丝织就的网，很美，一向很美。尤其当夜幕降临时，这些疤痕提醒着我，他原本有可能那么轻易地死去，可他依旧属于我，依旧在我身边，当我的头抵在他的肩膀、当我们在被单之下沉入梦乡时如此温暖鲜活、如此完美。但他不怎么愿意听谁讲他的疤痕漂亮，而说起来，我也一样。所以我仅是看着他，想要伸手触摸却仍未获得准许。 “你会原谅我吗？” “给我点时间，约翰。” “当然。”我轻声说道。 我尝试着辨认星座，却完全无法集中精神。我本已为此痛苦不堪，竟还非得动辄让事态严重出五十倍。若有歇洛克輠尔摩斯躺在你身畔，你又刚做出了无可挽回的蠢事，谁还管得了星宿呢？认出几个黄道星座之后我放弃了。如果没有他与我一起来看，无论是苏塞克斯的什么东西我都不愿多瞧一眼，而这就是问题，问题的关键所在，正因此我才陷入了这般境—— “亲爱的，我可不可以问你个颇为不妥的问题？” “可以。”我立即回答。 他一肘支起身子，翻身侧卧以注视我。 “你想要求我永远不要死去，这是不是不太公平？因为我办不到。” 我费力地吞咽着。这话背后有些辛酸的什么，辛酸而痛切。 “的确。”我低语道。 “我没指望着活过一八九一年（注），你瞧。”他轻柔地说下去。“而你挺过一九一八年（注2）简直是个奇迹。你也一样办不到。我们就不能找些其他方法更好地消磨余生吗？”(译注：1.本系列中，这一年侦探离开医生，之后三年在欧洲铲除莫里亚蒂的犯罪网络，详见系列前篇Birds to a Lighthouse/群鸟飞向灯塔。2.本系列中，医生参加了一战，在这一年因伤返回英国，详见系列前篇The Presbury Letters/珀斯博利信件。） “是的，没错，全都没错。但我想着这事停不下来。” “想着我会死？” “不。想着你心脏停跳时的模样。你不知道那是怎一番模样。” “我可知道那是怎一种感觉，这我向你保证，医生。”他咆哮道。“这我总还记得。所以劳烦你不要低估我的想象力，并且问问你自己，我当时是否为这么一回折磨人的发作而无比自豪。还是两次。” “这四天我所做的一切都完全没经思考。”我呻吟着。 “对此我不会与你意见相左，要是你觉得减轻心脏负担的良计就是主动使自己疏离——” “别说了，求你。我知道我做了什么，做得相当恶劣。别再提你的心了，把这一切都抛诸脑后吧——或许，我们该换一下，你的心是我于你所求的一切，而你早已拥有我的心了。” “那该是多么合算的一笔交易，用你的举世无双来换一样残缺不全的东西。有时你根本是个白痴，约翰，毋庸置疑。” “我知道我是。不过，说你会跟我复婚，求你。说你会的。” 福尔摩斯考虑着，迟疑不决。挪近些许，他从我的前额拨开我的头发。他伸手够来他的眼镜，戴上，直视着我的双眼，每一迹象都表明他即将道出极为严肃之事，于我们二人利害攸关，影响持续终生。在月光下他周身银灰，他的双目尤为如此，而没有他我一天也活不下去。我等着他传达最为严厉的判决，我自己的心跳得厉害。 “我指望着要有一场极其污秽下流的同性性爱。”他回答。 我咬住唇匿起一笑，可与歇洛克·福尔摩斯一起，这与微笑别无二致。于是我肆意向他微笑，群星重现光彩，我记起了诸个星座之位。 “是的，当然。” “污秽下流。”他重复道，手指再度穿梭于我发间。“我是想说，淫靡浪荡。” “悉听尊便。” 他摘下了眼镜。有的女人在老去之后，会发现自己嫁给了性欲颇为冷淡的生物。虽说我只能猜想世间缔结事实婚姻的男性伴侣屈指可数，或许有些男人也经受着同样的损失，然而，同我结婚的，恰巧是大不列颠人中性致最为高涨的老年男子。又一件对我来说本应不足为奇的事。我挪动着打算起身。 “你想往哪儿去？” “回屋里去。”我一头雾水地回答。 “不，有鉴于当前情形，我可不大乐意再进去。我们得在我的新居中行房，多谢。” 当然他是要这么说的。不过——又一次——我显然允许自己因他大惊小怪到了一种值得警惕的地步。 “在室外？”我喘息着询问。 “某种程度上来讲，我也还没得空建起任何一面墙。而当我说污秽下流，我的好伙计，你可免不了要纠缠其中。” “我可不敢妄想要对此存疑。”他吻起我的下颌，轻轻一顶让我偏过头去，我们头顶的群星闪起俏皮的光芒。 “离我们最近的邻居——我正是为此才特地购置此处房产——都住得远到没法注意我们，又近到足以令我们听见他们狗的吠叫。但这些你都知道。脱下你的睡袍。” 我照做了。“福尔摩斯，我……我们在这外面什么都没有。” “唔，”他说，顺着我的身躯向下印下一串湿吻。“我们瞧瞧我能不能想点办法用一样东西润湿另一样。” 他能，这是当然。而再过上不到十分钟，我已经支离破碎，感谢上苍，我的朋友认为他自身罪孽如此恒久地深植于我肌肤之中，这使得他能像四岁孩童一般不费吹灰之力便原谅我无比伤人之举。不，这不是我的本意。是错话。他确实会需要付出努力，有时会的，而那一夜他就尽了力去原谅我。我眼见他释怀，他一旦得回足够的自制、能够就这么允许一切从他优雅的指际滑落，便拒绝斤斤计较我的冒犯。我不能认为这种实际上得之不易的技巧与生俱来。我嫉妒他能有这样的能力，并深深希望我自己也能掌控这项专长。然而我们的不同之处既在于我们彼此相异的为人，亦在于我们对彼此爱得迥然不同。时至今日，他在有我相伴身边的感激之中度过每一天，我则日益贪婪，自他之处渴求更多。二者无从等量齐观，即便是同等热切。 事后，我们谁也不愿起身与彼此分离，或不妨说，离开我朋友新辟的居所。他对于我们的住处的选取一向别有心得，自始至终尽是如此。于是我们留在那里，我把头枕在他肩上，膝盖在他双腿之间。福尔摩斯伸出修长的胳臂够向毯子的一角，利落地一翻搭在我们身上。 “你在想什么？”我问。“我没法像你一样读心。” “唔，如果你足够留心，你应当还能够推理得出来。在这种时候我所想之事向来只有一样。” 在很久，很久，很久以前他就告诉过我那是什么了。那时的他还没过而立之年，仍未享誉世界，也不曾在欧陆亡命天涯。那时的我还会因门闩之声或园艺剪刀猝然闭合之声不觉畏缩，在受够世界折磨时渴望吗啡。如今想来，当时我们恰是以同一方式相互依偎，那么他是对的，我沉思道——我理应记得。 我所想之事向来只有一样。看着你（注）。 （译注：前文中并未直接提及，但似乎曾以侦探视角作出诠释。详见系列前篇Birds to a Lighthouse/群鸟飞向灯塔） 如果人人得知他有这么爱我，即便我能昭告于天下，即便我写下的不是短篇故事而是充斥情色的回忆录，凭谁也不会相信是真的。 在我们动身去伦敦参加婚礼前夕，我走进我们的卧室想打点行李，却迎来一个极大的惊喜。歇洛克·福尔摩斯站在穿衣镜前，打着淡蓝色的领巾，身着一套我从未见过的极合身的鸽灰燕尾夏装，床上放着一只薄纱衬里的盒子。我恰停在门口，稍稍平复了呼吸。他一向讲究时髦，甚至在他能为考究衣着自付账单之前亦是如此。除去那些他清癯甚于以往的艰难时光，他的身量并没有多大变化，因此每当福尔摩斯想要定制一身套装，他便会把订单送至他九十年代在杰明街（注）时常光顾的一名裁缝的儿子那里。（译注：Jermyn St.，伦敦市中心一条销售男士用品的特色商业街。） 他在镜中看到我的表情，脸上浮现出一个微笑。 “天哪。我还以为你会喜欢这么一身。” 我缓缓迈步向前，评头品足地双臂抱胸。“唔，我不。不是喜欢，我是说。” “不喜欢？” “不。我想该说是相当喜欢。” 我站在他身后，双手落在他精瘦的髋部上，感受着其下的骨骼与肌肉，把头靠在他的肩膀上。他嗅来像是馨香的烟丝，丁子香，以及他全然不羁的自我。 “你穿上这身衣服是想试试合身与否，还是说想本着友谊竞争的原则告诉我，我没有什么能够与之相匹？” “我穿上这身衣服，”他拖长腔调，漫无目的地玩弄着他的袖口，“是因为我猜这或许能够激发你把它扯下来的欲望。” “你聪明得很。” “我是个聪明得难以置信的家伙。何况——” 当我一只目标明确的手滑上他碳黑背心平坦的前襟时，我们的前门处突然传来一声敲响。我叹了口气，头垂向他颈后。 “这件外套大获成功，我想。”他一语双关道。“就等上一会。不管是谁我都会将他打发走人。” 我踢掉拖鞋坐到床上，腿一收盘了起来。我听见前门处传来的低语，然后门又关上了。门上锁的脆响在前厅中回荡。在苏塞克斯，其他的人谁都不会锁门，但福尔摩斯和我今生树敌众多，因此他不确保所有门窗均已锁严就绝不就寝。这可爱得荒唐。我听见他回来时，他的步伐更缓慢，也更慎重了。他出现在门口，英俊高挑得不可思议，肩靠在门框上。他脸上一切的情色挑逗都已不见踪迹。 “邮差刚刚送来一封加急电报。是雷斯垂德发来的。他说，他本可打电话来，但他并不愿……也就是说，比起把这消息说出口他更情愿诉诸文字。” “到底出什么事了？”我高声问道。 福尔摩斯轻敲着手中的字条，皱起双眉。“我亲爱的伙计，在婚礼之前我们另添了一项安排。是在上午，那么我们只有两点到圣詹姆士教堂去了。” “看在上帝份上，福尔摩斯。” “又一场葬礼。”他轻声说。“我很遗憾。” 人年届古稀之时难免要参加许许多多的葬礼，但对谁而言这都不会是司空见惯的事。虽说死亡是惯常之事，人总不会习惯老友离世，也不会习惯死亡。当然，对于一个两度亲历战火的人而言，死亡是最不足为奇的事之一，对于我们每个人而言均是如此。但我曾过于频繁地面对死亡，因而终我余年，我只愿不再失去任何曾成为我一部分的人。福尔摩斯肃穆地走近，把字条递给我读。 “噢，福尔摩斯。”我轻呼。“不。不。我还以为他在康复。” “从什么中康复？肺炎的发作？那也有可能，可谁都挺不过年老。他八十六岁了，约翰。” 我一言不发，任由字条掉落到地板上。福尔摩斯走上前来，我的头靠上了他的胸膛，他的手探上来理着我的头发。 “他是个好人，一生幸福美满。”我的朋友说。“身后留下了两个非常、非常健康的女儿，还有不下七个胖外孙。其中一个胖得几乎令人担忧。” 我双臂环过他后背，呼吸着他的气息。寿终正寝，儿孙满堂，事业稳定而又于人有所助益……足够了，一个人有了这些也能别无所求了。而我，自从初遇就爱上面前这个不可思议的天才，再经历一系列接踵而至的奇案——称为冒险也未尝不可——应有尽有甚而更多，我本应知足了。 然而，这并不足够，我是知道的。我永远不知餍足。 次日下午我们出发前往伦敦。福尔摩斯把他的摩洛哥匣子悄悄塞进他的旅行包时，我并不感到惊讶。可卡因比吗啡强些，安全得多；尽管他不动声色，我也知道这一次葬礼对他的情绪不无影响。 我说了，我并不感到惊讶。 但我咬着唇内直至见血，才克制住没朝他尖叫：你不能边说爱我边对自己做出这种事来。你不能这样。你不能。不能。 随后的傍晚，在福尔摩斯为黑色轻便马车付钱时，我站在街角，任由伦敦的气息涌向我。铅框玻璃窗，铺路石，潮湿的花岗岩以及它腐败的臭气，旧友一般的悬铃木和兄弟一般的煤气灯。我在苏塞克斯不会终日思念伦敦，但当我回到这里，我便再也不想离开。我渴望能够再度步入我们朴素可爱的前门（注），以缓解心头思念之痛。福尔摩斯坚持要由他来拎着我们的行李。目睹福尔摩斯身处伦敦，矫健而优雅地向我缓步走来，我好奇地想，伦敦是否每时每刻都在为他恸哭，哀号着请求自己的王储归来。他属于伦敦，又抛下了伦敦。为了我。换做我是伦敦，我可无法轻易原谅我自己这般横刀夺爱。（译注：指221B的门。详见前篇Four Minor Interludes for the Solo Violin/提琴独奏的四个小插曲 的篇末） “来吧。”他说，我们穿过宽敞安静的街道后，他放下一个包，按起门铃。“快到晚餐的时候了，你也知道他对时间的执念。” 一走上楼，宏伟堂皇的客厅门在福尔摩斯的轻触之下打开，我们迈步行进。迈克罗夫特·福尔摩斯坐在他的高背轮椅中，在炉火前打盹。一条深红的编织毯搭在他腿上，他肘边的桌上有一杯雪利酒，放在一份展开过又折起的报纸旁。他硕大而布满皱纹的面孔十分安详，他无疑少了好些头发，但是看上去同我上次见到他时一样精神矍铄。他那并未同样经受脱发之苦的弟弟把我们的行李放了下来，将他打量一番。 “要是你再胖上那么一点，我的哥哥，这张轮椅你就坐不进去了。到那时候你能往哪去呢？” 迈克罗夫特的眼睛当即睁开，最为奇妙纯粹的热忱掠过他的面容。然而片刻之间那神情便消失了，取而代之的是一个苦笑，以及他检视我们时惯常的福尔摩斯式的冷静、淡漠、近乎慵懒的审视目光。终我一生，我不曾见过一对更吝于表露情感的兄弟，也不曾见过更为深笃的手足之情。我的福尔摩斯同样镇静而温文有礼，同时仿佛内心喜不自胜。这让我想起我已逝的哥哥，想起我与他之间从未有过这种感情。我突然深深庆幸，若是我们二人——福尔摩斯和我——我们中只有一个能够了解这种兄弟情深，这个人会是福尔摩斯。其中每一刻都是他应得的。在其余方面，是我更为幸运。 “歇洛克，你变得愚钝了。人们总做得出更宽大的椅子，而我既有门路，也不缺钱财。另外，华生医生，真高兴见到你。旅程如何？我希望延搁的那一站不是特别恼人，鉴于那里似乎有个尚可的咖啡馆。” “你是怎么——”我开口。 “显而易见。”我的朋友叹了口气。“他知道从伊斯特本到伦敦的火车行程表以及途中站点，并且我们二人谁也没有因为六十八分钟的延误显得心烦意乱。我们既非饥肠辘辘，亦未因此恼怒，因此有个小餐馆，多谢关心，迈克罗夫特，那里的冷烤雉确实还算可口。卡特哪去了？” 我们的主人眨了眨双眼。“我让他离开一阵，等你们走后再回来。你在此作留期间，有他在毫无益处，他会坚持再三与你交谈，事后私下向我抱怨你的措辞。” “噢，操。”福尔摩斯感伤地说。“我还以为他思想挺开明的。” 迈克罗夫特借怒视忍下了微笑。“总之，我考虑到，既然你们二位要使用客卧，你们不会惦念他的。我也不是不能自己摇轮椅。而且，或许我是在过分倚仗你的慷慨，但我也没觉得这事你做不了。” “就算他办不到，也可以让我来做。”我微笑着说。“你考虑得很周全。” 迈克罗夫特輠尔摩斯不能算是疾病缠身。然而，他也不能算是身体健康。久坐的生活习惯导致了他血液循环上的问题，他骨质疏松，肺部也境况不佳。可这么说来，他也已经八十岁了。让他毫无辅助地走上超出三十英尺左右的距离是很困难的，因为这会使他头晕目眩，故会极易导致摔倒，进而引发严重得多的后果。因此过去两年里，他白天只得坐在轮椅上，由一名不大受他待见的私人助理推着走。他时常会换换空气外出来看望我们，而卡特会回到城中，直到几天之后回程需要他时再来。有时，虽说并非近日，我们会到伦敦来。我开始醒悟身处此地令我多么愉快。我过去一周是那样郁郁寡欢。仅凭迈克罗夫特的远见卓识和他弟弟对与他共处的喜爱，竟这么快就能使我如此心满意足，似乎完全难以置信。 “迈克罗夫特就是思虑周全的化身，而我这么说并不是种赞美。”我的朋友慢吞吞地说。“但不管怎样，我要给咱们倒两杯雪利酒，祝他健康。” 我们的晚餐无比愉快。单单是菜肴, 冷龙虾和牛舌派，还有精致的热牛肉切片配成堆的芦笋和黄油煮土豆，就已十分上乘。歇洛克·福尔摩斯几近忘乎所以，伦敦的气息和他哥哥的陪伴使他妙语连珠，乘着如潮逸兴凌驾于我之上。虽然在我看来，迈克罗夫特·福尔摩斯的魅力仍不及我的朋友，他也一样兴致高昂。我边享用一席佳肴，边聆听两位极有见地的人争论达尔文著作的社会影响，几年前将英格兰所有的铁路并入四大公司的《铁路法案》，关于强制德国赔款的问题（注）, 以及壁毯能否被视为油画那样的艺术形式。（译注：此指一战德国赔款） 我予以评论。我凝神谛听。我热爱身处此地。 甜点上过，我的和福尔摩斯的一口未动。福尔摩斯暂且离席，我目送他而去时，转而遇上他哥哥的双眼，眼神表明他一如既往地于不经意间洞察一切。他立刻捕捉到了我的担忧（注），并假定是出于通常的缘由。这确是惯常的担忧，却另有更为危急的缘由，谢天谢地，此等想法不曾在他睿智的头脑中浮现。迈克罗夫特对于他弟弟的健康状况一无所知，对我来说这令人极不自在，我却也说不出什么得当的话。在第一次发作之后，我问过福尔摩斯，我应不应该——或说福尔摩斯会不会——写信告知他的兄长。 “谁都不能知道这件事，我是说任何人都绝对不行。”他冷冷地回答。 “可毫无疑问，”我抗议道，“他——” “我的健康状况由我决定是否宜于透露，若你胆敢对我哥哥走露一点风声，你将使我处于一种针对你个人的怒意之中，无论是你是我——听好，华生，不论我们两个谁——都丝毫不会乐于消受。”福尔摩斯半点情面不留地宣告，随即阔步离开了房间。 虽说难于遵从，但这项要求也是情理之中。因此，除去我、我们花园中的鸟儿和我们蜂房中的蜜蜂，此事无人知晓。我保守下的秘密能把大英博物馆填得爆满。 “我从来没有感谢过你，你知道。”迈克罗夫特说。“我本该早些这么做的。” “谢我什么？”我问，摸不着头脑。 “这不可能轻松。” 我明白了他的意思。我也理解其中绝没有一丝恶意，迈克罗夫特只不过是比谁都要了解他的弟弟，了解他无意之中会造成的苦难。或许他比我还要清楚。这时我是如此感激迈克罗夫特没有说“这本不应该轻松”，我几乎想紧紧握住他的手。 “我是训练有素的医生，两经战火的老兵。”反之，我这样回答，往我们三人考究的杯中倒着更多的勃艮第。“我不喜欢轻松的事物。我喜欢物有所值的。” “说得不错。” “如果之前没有你，你知道，”我慢慢补充道，“我想我根本没法拥有他。我欠你的远远更多。” 我字字实言，如同衷心的感恩祷告。要想使迈克罗夫特·福尔摩斯吃惊实属不易，然而无论如何，我做到了。他沉思着盯着他的书架看了几秒，其中一些优雅整洁地列满了《海滨杂志》，上面刊载有对他弟弟的记述，我所写下的记述，那些处于写作阶段中每况愈下的故事，实话说如今已是不堪入目。但由于我个人的原因，我之前无法停笔，也难以再停笔。渐渐地，他微微发红的朦胧灰眼移回我的方向。 “如果你真的认为你欠我更多，”迈克罗夫特喃喃地说，“那我想我的观点不言自明了。” 福尔摩斯回来了，整着他的领结，轻声哼着一支怪诞的小华尔兹，倾身斜掠回到了他的座位上。我只需一瞥他的双眼便知，他并未因虑及次日之事使用毒品。他的双眸十分清澈，十分敏锐，是十足的灰色，然后他的目光突然转向我的双眼。他一看见我的神情，以及迈克罗夫特举起酒杯时的神情，那轻快的旋律当即停了下来。 “任何人在与他人畅饮三瓶红酒后小解回来，都得如此被检视一番吗？”他低声咕哝。 “歇洛克，你带你的小提琴来了吗？”他的哥哥回驳道。 福尔摩斯咬起下唇，对我们两人怒目而视。 他迟疑着。 但之后，我们稍作劝诱，他便拉起琴来。 但愿我能免于辨认福尔摩斯当晚所奏的乐曲，苍天可鉴，我是记不起来了。等我们迁至客厅，倒过一轮波尔图酒后，我确知他演奏已超过一小时了。可他所演奏的——既若无物又言尽一切。缓慢、慵懒的赋格曲飘上半空，化作同等忧郁的华尔兹，转瞬之间，又不费吹灰之力变作肖邦与巴赫的片段，辅以仿佛一伸手去便会破碎的俄罗斯吉普赛旋律的浮光掠影。彼时彼刻，我并不觉得他是为他的听众奏乐。当夜他只为自己而演奏。此情此景，也是理所应当。我朋友那一向仿佛属于他身体一部分的琴弓在弦上游走，如同在包扎一处隐秘的伤口。 即使我知道那痛楚所在，又能如何？若我能看出他的心跳不会如他的清誉一般长存，他可曾怪罪我？如果我毁了他的秘密，正如他毫不留情地点破我的秘密一般，在那旋律中又能寻得什么恶意？当然，什么也没有。其中并无声讨，并无不悦，纵使阴郁，却从无谴责。当他的背微微弓起、手指如飞地在琴弦上移动时，我之所闻既无愧疚也无控诉。 不，那不是痛楚。或说不曾切中要害。那只不过是深深的、半带微笑的忧伤，这忧伤将永生尾随他，如同律动无歇的浪潮，直至他已不在人世感受忧伤之日。 伴随我们着装的晨光比苏塞克斯的来得昏暗，但暗得熟悉，犹如一件久经使用、已然磨损得柔软的旧衣。我们在参加婚礼的正式礼服衣袖上佩上了黑纱，因为我们将不会有时间停下来更衣。我一完事，福尔摩斯就把他的小银框眼镜放进他合衬的漂亮外衣的内袋里，伸出了手臂。我挽住他的手臂，推开客卧的门。 “轻些。”我耳语道。 “拜托。”福尔摩斯哼了一声。“我哥哥听力绝佳，但绝不及他身处惊蹿牛群中都能酣然沉眠的能力。他的轮椅就在床边，我还把他所有的表都调慢了一小时。他至少能安稳地睡到十点。” “他会气急败坏的。”当我们匆匆走下迈克罗夫特的楼梯时，我说。 “我知道。”他幸灾乐祸地抬眼一望。“那岂不是妙极了吗？” 我们的路程很短，也许是因为我害怕抵达目的地，于是抵达的时刻反而来得更快。警用马车队列外的葬礼场地上满是熟悉的面孔。黑色的裤管从繁茂的青草之中立出，黑色的礼帽在青叶之下浮动，黑色的阴郁低语在青春不再、空余追忆的人群之间传响。我向好些人点头致意，却不及福尔摩斯多。他在我身旁始终缄口不语、神情肃穆，我可以凭生命起誓，他在与众多素不相识的家伙握手。也许他与他们的确是素不相识，毕竟我的朋友颇有声望。歇洛克·福尔摩斯要比围在我们身周的苏格兰场警察高出不少，他握着一个又一个人的手。虽说我的朋友甚至没有补充一字，但是自始至终，他应和着他们的每一句话。是的，他生前是个好人。是的，他会深受缅怀。是的，他的家人能有这么一位父亲很幸运。不，没什么能逃过他的火眼金睛。 当那不知姓名的年轻探长哀哀自语着走开时，这最后一句没能避免招致我的一瞥。 “……除非你所指的碰巧是犯罪证据。”他轻声说完。 我咬唇忍下一个宠溺的微笑，作为替代攥了攥他的手。 最终，静了下来，致哀者抬眼，便看见了杰弗里·雷斯垂德。我们还没跟他说上话。他站在一方掘得很深、制作考究的坟墓坑首，穿着全黑的丧服，细瘦的手里捏着圆顶硬礼帽。矮小的身材、满是皱纹的皮肤、褪色的黑外套跟他深色的小眼睛，让他看上去与一只地底动物如出一辙。他的头在考量之中来回转着，观测整个场面，显然正要讲话。一具下衬着黑色宽缎的棺材安放在他的左侧。许多警官环在他周围。我叫得出他们中每个人的名字。在墓的另一侧站着家属，所有的家属，包括那六个肥胖的孙辈（还有一个胖得惊人）。我也叫得出他们每一个的名字。 雷斯垂德举起一只手，这安静愈发降为沉寂。 “没有必要让我来说些大家公认的事实，”他开口讲道，“所以，我不会跟你们说托比亚斯·葛莱森不仅是一名优秀的警察，而且还是一位绝顶高明的探长。说这些是不妥当的，因为这样会使人以为我觉得你们中，会有人不是早已相信这些事实。而你们对此是深信不疑的，人人皆是。苏格兰场以托比亚斯·葛莱森为荣，他捉拿归案的罪犯数不胜数，全凭他的孜孜不倦、火眼金睛跟机智聪慧。” 福尔摩斯本可对此嗤之以鼻，但他没有。他只是重新把手滑到我的肘部紧紧握住，因为他一直把葛莱森视为都市警力的一员干将，并相应地对待他。也就是说，比对待一般人稍少几分藐视。 “不，我不打算劝服你们相信这些，”雷斯垂德继续说，“因为你们早已深谙于心。但有个故事，是我想要你们知道的。在我刚刚加入警局不久时，我是个狂妄的家伙。我相当粗鲁莽撞，又一无所成，比谁都更容易不分青红皂白大打出手；我粗心大意，却骄傲易怒得好似我刚刚亲手将魔鬼本人绳之以法。你们中的某些人是知道的。”他说道，在我看来，他目光所落之处比人群的多数要高出一些，似乎在看着福尔摩斯。“而某些人甚至帮着我改掉了这些毛病。不过在场的任何一位，都不曾对我说过托比亚斯·葛莱森曾对我讲的话。那时我刚升上探长，因此比做警员时更加举止失措。我对着警官们大喊大叫，为难证人，就好像我这样破案就能快上一点，好像这有助于我的事业一般。那时候我看上去该有多像个毛头小子啊。不管怎样，有这么一桩案子，让我只能向着任何一样活物咆哮却束手无策，愿上帝保佑急性子的人。好吧，碰巧葛莱森也是刚刚晋升，受指派负责同一案，有一天我为一点鸡毛蒜皮的小错——我已经记不起来的小差错——痛斥一名警察，托比亚斯转向我，接着他说：‘你觉得一切进展不顺？’我说，该死的，没错，当然进展不顺。我说一切进展能有多不顺就有多不顺。然后他说：‘就跟你的丈夫在这四天里惨遭谋杀、永远不会回到你身边，你的小孩哭个不停，你又没法跟小家伙们解释清楚一样诸事不顺？’” 咬着嘴唇，雷斯垂德把指间的帽子转了个个儿。 “我没有一夜之间就解决问题。”又过了几秒他说。“我没能立刻破案，我的性格也没有全改。我还是个骄傲的人，并且你们中某些人或许注意得到，我也还有那么一点脾气。”几声轻笑飘在坟茔上空。“但从那次之后，我再也没像以前那样看待问题。因为这就是托比亚斯处世的方式。当然他那时候也跟后生一样莽撞，对于局外人疑心重重，我盯着他的错误，就跟他盯着我的错误一样。我记忆犹新，年轻的时候我们像一对公猫一样掐架。但若是他没有问过我那个小小的问题，我就不会是如今的样子。我希望你们知道这个。他有资格以自己为傲，你知我知。不过他也使他周围的人感到骄傲，而偶然之间，他使身边人中的一个变得更好了。我心存感激。谢谢大家。” “这，”在棺材缓缓降入大地时我说，“是我听过最好的致辞之一。你知道葛莱森的这个故事吗？” “不。”我的朋友说，听上去十分疲惫。“但如果他还活着，我会因此跟他握手。雷斯垂德以前完全难以忍受。” “这群人里有的家伙也对某个咨询侦探持同一观点。” “该咨询侦探对此心知肚明并欣然承认他是个混蛋。但，务必记住，他也是个天才。” 我拍了一下这天才的手臂。 “想想看，我有生之年竟会有这么一天确实想跟葛莱森交谈。”福尔摩斯沉吟道。“还做不到了。真是滑稽。当我二十五岁、他抬眼瞪我就跟瞪着个活过来的稻草人一样的时候，你怎么这样跟我说，我都不会信的。” 当雷斯垂德周围的致哀者散去、被他的致辞打动的那些人正缓缓走回等待的马车时，我们终于得到了他的注意。雷斯垂德立即向我们走来，严肃地举帽向葛莱森其中一名成年的女儿道别。他棕色的双眼因为看见我们而闪闪发光。 “不幸的场合。”他说，紧握住福尔摩斯的手，接下来转而握住我的。 “但发言不错。”福尔摩斯回答，递出打开的香烟盒。 雷斯垂德拿出两支，一支递给我，然后倾身靠向福尔摩斯已经划着的火柴。“在当前状况下，我全力以赴了。他是个很好的人，托比。诚实，可靠，诸如此类，而且还不止于此。如果我们待的时间够久，会发现我们场里大多数人也一样。不过我倒也不能说他破了开膛手的谋杀案，是不是？” “的确。”福尔摩斯承认说，朝着半空吞云吐雾。“但他擅长本职，他的家人也很幸福，这值得一提，还不仅仅是值得一提。” “福尔摩斯先生！福尔摩斯先生！”一个熟悉的声音叫喊着。 “天佑吾王，我们完蛋了。”雷斯垂德嘟哝着，深吸了口烟。 总督察斯坦莱·霍普金大步朝我们走来。他已处于花甲之年，依旧精神抖擞，鹤发童颜。虽说他的眼中仍充满着葬礼带来的沉重，但是他的嘴角笑得咧到了耳根。他把手伸在面前，好似是手握弯刀穿越青葱密林一般。当这只手停在福尔摩斯面前时，福尔摩斯检视片刻之后将它握住，喜爱与不耐烦在他深陷的眼中交战。 “霍普金。”他和蔼地说。 “你在这儿啊。我们可到处找你呢。”雷斯垂德冷淡地说，换来我一记瞪视。 “真的吗？”霍普金喜形于色地问道。“华生医生，见到您真是太高兴了。福尔摩斯先生，太久不见了。您不在，伦敦几乎难以为继，您知道。我们几乎难以为继。但不管怎样，我们挺住了，因为我们必须如此。伦敦也是，警方也是。” “我逐渐得出结论，这都市似乎还屹立未倒，没错。”福尔摩斯回应，并无刻薄之意。“知道苏格兰场也一样是多么令人欢欣鼓舞。你的妻子怎么样？” “丽莎很好，谢谢您，福尔摩斯先生，我会把您热忱的问候转达给她。唉，就前两天下午她还跟我说：‘有时候感觉好像如今的伦敦物是人非了，是不是，斯坦莱？’我说，没有歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生在就是这样，千真万确，而丽莎没再说一个字，因为那一定就是原因所在了。老天知道，虽说过得艰难，但我们还是无恙地挺过了战争。不过，我在这边应付得还不错，福尔摩斯先生，我觉得我自己有几个创意会让您吃惊的。与现代科技并驾齐驱，这是我不断向我的下属们强调的宗旨，而这完全归功于您，先生。完完全全是归功于歇洛克輠尔摩斯先生，是不是，探长？” “大概是。”雷斯垂德说，听上去都反胃了。 “那么！歇洛克·福尔摩斯和华生医生，重返伦敦。葛莱森，可怜人，他本该感到荣幸的。愿上帝让他安息。我听说您二位搬到苏塞克斯去了？南唐斯丘陵？请务必告诉我，像二位这么精力充沛的人在乡下是怎样打发时间的。” “我们养羊。”福尔摩斯面无表情地报告道。 “请原谅？” “我们是牧羊人。”我和颜悦色地附和道，挽过福尔摩斯的胳臂。 雷斯垂德，上帝保佑他，一下咳嗽起来，如果他挪得动一英寸，他准咳得能向我们西边走上五尺。他弓下身去，无助地对着地面干咳。我有些年没见到过这我熟知内情的景象了，而我相当欢迎这景象。 “您不是说真的吧。”霍普金赞叹道。 “牧羊人，没错。”福尔摩斯接着说。“你知道吗，总督察，羊毛能以一种特有的方式，在材质纤维中就给织出加密的图案，从而创造出一种无法破译的密码。对于那些掌握此计者，这是传达绝密信息的绝佳手段。我们正进行着更深入的研究。应我兄长本人所求。”他悄声补充。 “老天。”霍普金担忧地瞥了一眼雷斯垂德，后者似乎要在怡人的夏日空气中溺死了。“要推进这么个项目，你们一定受制于绝对机密吧。那都要做什么呢?” “赶羊。”我解释说。“喂羊。给羊洗澡。剪羊毛。基本上就是牧羊。我们剩余的时间，当然，用于加密信息的实际织造。目前我们只能掌握围巾的织法，但我们希望能尽快进展到套头毛衣，这样能承载更多具体信息。” 余下的谈话不幸中断，因为这时候雷斯垂德发出了一种很可能把他从里向外翻出来的声音。我们看到霍普金相当殷勤地跑过去，友好地拍着雷斯垂德的背，接着，当看见对方自这好意的暴力中恢复过来后，他便十分惋惜地向我们所有人道别。看上去，一个总督察的生活是忙碌的，他的职责召唤他立刻回到场里去，但他非常希望我们在伦敦期间能顺道拜访。再度紧握过我们的手之后，斯坦莱·霍普金消失在逗留的人群中。 “你们是怎么做到的？”雷斯垂德呻吟道，一手扶住额头。“怎么办到的？这太不人道了。” 福尔摩斯跟我目光相接，邪恶挑逗——说真的，是闷燃的炽热——这神情很容易就能追溯回一八九零年。 “福尔摩斯对于欺骗之道是轻车熟路。”我微笑道。“而我参过军。就这样。” “我觉得你们弄裂了我一根肋骨。” “要我看一看吗？” “不。”他哼着，终于挺起腰来，因痛瑟缩了一下。“谢谢你，不用了，医生。不过那一着真是妙绝了。” “一向乐意为警方效劳。”福尔摩斯快活地说。 “很高兴我赶个正着。我说，”雷斯垂德继续说到，“你们两个这身打扮就像在白金汉宫有约似的。当真是要去那儿？” “不，是个婚礼。噢，嗨，跟我们一起来吧！”福尔摩斯高声说道，打了个响指。“我们都可以带个伴陪着同去。至于为什么，我是半点头绪没有。” 一个微笑轻绽在雷斯垂德的薄唇。“如今还请我去的场合只剩退休纪念会和葬礼了。能有个婚礼岂不痛快。” “那么，你得跟我们一起来。不过有件事我跟华生得先去做。如果你准我们离开个——得了，管他呢，你们两个最好一起过来。” 福尔摩斯走开去，他的步子比我的要长，更比雷斯垂德的长出不少。前探长跟我交换着困惑的目光，因为我的朋友正往墓地里越走越深，而不是往外走。他向左拐了一点，转向一丛人工灌木，天知道他打算去哪里。我们勉强追随着他的步伐，崩裂的碑石从身边飞掠而过。不止我弄不清他到一座公墓内里是想做什么，现在连雷斯垂德也跟我一样，完全一头雾水。我们周围什么都没有，除了死者、草丛，还有在这二者之上高飞的鸟儿。 “福尔摩斯，你要去哪儿？”我最终叫道。“我们只剩二十分钟了！” 然而他径自向前走，敏捷地避开了路标、石头和锈迹斑斑的小铁栏，直到地面突然下倾，我们已经远离动身离开的人群的视线。我们的面前有一小片草地，一列警戒一般卧在一旁的方形坟墓，一尊陵墓，土中还有五六块红石匾。福尔摩斯停住了脚。接着我的朋友瞥见了他在找的东西，招手叫我们接着走。最后，总共走了大约四分之一英里后，我们停在一行榆树下。这里有一片简单、空旷、杂草丛生的空地，迎接我们的是地面上的一个小坑，以及一把铁锹。 “那么，是有只松鼠死了吗？”雷斯垂德问。 福尔摩斯瞪了他一眼，不过只是半心半意。他走到坑边，召我们到他身边去。 接着他从外套内袋里掏出了一只小小的摩洛哥匣子。 若能说有一刻，我觉得自己似乎体会了心脏停跳的感觉，那么就是此时此刻。 当雷斯垂德不再盯着福尔摩斯——因为福尔摩斯在盯着我——转而望向我的时候，他屏住了呼吸。“你们为什么……好吧，你们俩总得有一个要该死地告诉我是怎么回事。你没事吧，医生？医生？福尔摩斯先生——” “他没事。”福尔摩斯柔声说。他把匣子递给雷斯垂德。“看看里面是什么。” 雷斯垂德猛地打开匣子。匣子里有一只注射针管，当然，这我知道。片刻之后雷斯垂德明白过来，他的目光惊异地飞回我朋友身上。 我朋友对毒品上瘾并非缘于要以此为消遣，也不是缘于时髦，甚至不是缘于毒品带来的快感。他对毒品的瘾，是因为他脑海中挥之不去的可怕事物远远糟于我任何的想象，而雷斯垂德很清楚这一点。我不知道福尔摩斯可曾私下告诉过探长，他自身的阴郁最初是如何愈演愈烈的，或是他的哥哥是因何而终身不娶的，或是可卡因是怎样自多年前、从我们达成那项协议起便代替了吗啡的（注）。但即便如此，雷斯垂德也了解福尔摩斯的阴暗情绪，甚至在它们撕扯着我时也会稍感痛苦。（译注：详见系列前篇Hallowed Be Thy Name/尊汝名为圣） 我恳求地望向福尔摩斯。我的心再度开始跳动，只是跳得如此，如此之快。 “你确定吗？”我低语道。“当真确定你可以——你可以？” 福尔摩斯思索着我的疑问，自前探长那里取回匣子。但他很快开了口，眉头微皱。他的目光投向我，近乎腼腆。 “我不愿再看见你脸上的某种表情了。仅此而已。所以，是的。”他总结道。“如果你希望的话，我可以这样做。” 他说着就把那匣子扔进坑里，显然，那个坑是他为此专门雇人来挖的。他伸手拿来铁锹，把尘土填进洼处。 坑很快给填满了。 然后结束了。 不妨说，歇洛克·福尔摩斯，会在我们今后共度的时光中，不断把我惊得哑口无言。他那变化多端的手法尚未因岁月流逝而枯竭，或者因频频使用而过时（注），诸如此类。他是奇迹的创造者，是不可思议之事的缔造人，与此同时，我被允许目睹一切。这是我的特权，是我今生至高无上的荣幸。（译注：语出《空屋》） 福尔摩斯一只手握着铁锹的长柄，微微靠在上面，使脚踝富于意味地互相交叠，并狠狠瞪着我们两个。突然之间他显得相当脆弱，似乎在挑唆我们里谁先来评价一番，发表或愚蠢、或挑剔、或冷漠、或仅仅是不对头的评论。 雷斯垂德突然咳了一声。 “我不知道你大体上如何行事，华生医生。”他说，听上去肃然起敬。“不过到了这个时候换做是我，我会吻他。” 于是我照做了。 纯粹是数十载习惯使然，福尔摩斯的双唇在我的唇下移动。随后，铁锹倒了，他轻喘着向后迈了半步，微微趔趄，他清瘦英俊的面庞上带着我所见过的最为奇异的表情，仿佛我刚刚长出了翅膀，并用翅膀扇了他一耳光。片刻过后，在他露出微笑前半秒，他脸红了。而我觉得即使我在强忍大笑时，我自己也必定是涨红了脸，而雷斯垂德的耳朵无疑已经变成了粉红色。福尔摩斯的嘴在惊异之中张开，竭力寻找话语，而又闭上了——我相信有两次。 雷斯垂德鼓起了掌，否则，我想我们三个怎么也走不出那一小片静谧、圣洁的草地。 “漂亮。”他说，一边鼓掌一边转身爬上斜坡。“绝对妙不可言。棒极了。上帝啊，多好的一天。我们去参加婚礼吧，先生们，我挺想喝上一杯。” 我们对着雷斯垂德窄小的背影又看了一会，之后福尔摩斯对我笑颜逐开，他把铁锹踢开，我们两个牵着手跟了上去。 自从玛德琳·斯托克斯的婚事宣布以来，我就一直满怀期待。福尔摩斯亦同。而我必须稍作解释。 很久以前——我也想不出其他什么方式来开始这样一个故事——歇洛克·福尔摩斯一贫如洗。尽管身无分文，但他的为人与现在并无不同，总急于洗雪他所见的一切冤屈，并且同样冷静地意欲靠才智谋生。于是他成为了一名执业咨询侦探。当时他从这桩事业中获利甚微，于是他开始在贝克街找合适的住所，并寻获一名新的合租者（一个名叫约翰·华生的人）。该项安排尘埃落定后不久（我对此时刻心满意足），一位名叫格蕾丝·斯托克斯的贫穷主妇找上福尔摩斯的门来，她有三个小孩——艾米，马丁和乔治。格蕾丝斯托克斯希望能以谋杀罪诬陷她的丈夫。格蕾丝·斯托克斯有充分理由来渴求这一结果，因为任何自称为人的人，都无法设想她丈夫强施于自己骨肉的暴行。（注）（译注：详见系列前篇Four Minor Interludes for the Solo Violin/提琴独奏的四个小插曲） 福尔摩斯感到道义上的自相矛盾，没能接下这一案，但他却给了她他拿不出的五十英镑。而任何头脑清醒的人，都不会向自己惹不起的那类人借这么五十英镑。 幸而我的朋友当时并非完全头脑清醒。 我们还回了这五十英镑，但那不是故事的重点。此后，孩子们靠着一名素不相识的陌生人的一时慷慨，跟他们的姨妈一起住在西苏塞克斯。福尔摩斯每年都会收到一封信，直到他们长大成人。每一次都是由艾米、马丁和乔治合写的。显然他们的母亲和姨妈没告诉他们多少，只是要他们写信给一位匿名的恩人。可那是怎样的信啊！他们跟福尔摩斯讲着树丛，讲着热气腾腾的酥皮羊肉馅饼，讲着只要在附近某条小溪里浸上三次就能神奇地变成魔杖的枝条。他们在同一个信封里，一个接一个地向他诉说小小的心碎和赢得的拼写比赛，讲着死去的鸟儿被发现后，又给放在大人们能相应找到它们的地方，讲着他们对于炖牛肚可食用性的观点，讲着福尔摩斯能从自己孩子口中听到的所有奇妙的事物（要是他跟我能有孩子的话）。贝克街小分队里的大多数人偶尔会急需父亲般的忠告，不过——斯托克斯家孩子的信，无不使我的朋友在看见回信地址时露出微笑。他并未流露出骄傲的神色，像他应得的那样，而是出于纯粹的人之常情。 艾米·雷文斯伍德——婚前原姓斯托克斯——二十二岁时在分娩中去世。当福尔摩斯听说这消息时，吗啡探出了它丑恶的头。她深受缅怀。 马丁·斯托克斯在战争中阵亡，独身无嗣。他为他的国家英勇奋战，被安葬在法国，死于击中他大腿的来复枪伤。 乔治·斯托克斯在战时留在了英格兰，因为他担任一家罐装食品工厂的厂主这一宝贵职位，为军人——像我这样的人们——提供尽可能最优质的现代补给，虽说那食物的味道实在是不敢恭维。他有一个女儿和一个儿子，艾玛和克莱夫。 克莱夫和他的妻子玛姬·斯托克斯有一名独生女。 她名叫玛德琳。福尔摩斯和我收到她婚礼的请柬那天，有大概四个小时，我们谁都像彻头彻尾的白痴一样收不住笑容。 而时候终于到了。 我们三个到达婚礼现场晚了些，只得在外面徘徊。我们透过高大的灰门，注视着一个纤小的白衣身影以及一个高一些、身穿深蓝晨礼服的身影，注视着聚集于此见证他们缔结婚姻、大约有六十位宾客的人群。没过多久，诸事完毕，誓言已然立下，我们都从教堂而下，到了附近一间酒店中装潢不错的休息室、餐厅和大堂。服务生端着冰镇牡蛎、盛着美酒的杯盏和法式冷盘，从窗外射入的光正开始消减，而悬着的枝形吊灯竞相生辉。纵然记起了我们的老同事和他安详的离世，我依旧觉得我简直无法更加愉快。 “我欠你们情，”雷斯垂德说着，又咽下另一只牡蛎。“这些年来头一次参加婚礼。婚礼比葬礼不知强出多少倍。” 有那么一会，我朋友像只巨大的灰鸟般偏了偏头。接着他走开了，因为他瞥见了玛德琳圠灿斯——婚前原姓斯托克斯——热情地招手请他到她的新婚丈夫那边。她似乎周身裹着亚麻织物与米色绸缎，榛色眼睛，浅金的秀发卷曲在脸边。她的新郎比她要远远瘦上不少、高出不少，面容瘦削而棱角分明，有着十分友善的蓝眼睛。福尔摩斯亲切地跟他们致意，与那位先生谈天，而我的喉咙则微微发紧。 “你们是怎么认识这家人的？”雷斯垂德发问道，从一个托盘取来一满杯酒递给我。 “福尔摩斯搭救过新娘落难的曾祖母。”我说。 “啊，”雷斯垂德举杯时眨了眨眼。“那是当然。那么，敬歇洛克·福尔摩斯。愿他长命百——” 话没说完雷斯垂德就僵住了，正赶上我的朋友回来。发现我们手臂半举、我盯着一动不动的雷斯垂德，福尔摩斯轻轻推了推我的肩膀。 “你把探长弄坏了。” “我可没有。”我辩驳着，放下手臂，发现这次祝酒被抛到了九霄云外。“雷斯垂德？” “看，”他低语道。“看呐。” 人群稍分开了些，我才望过去。 “啊。”歇洛克·福尔摩斯说，声音带着笑意。 在房间另一头，那些华贵的长毛绒椅子之一上坐着一个女人，她正与另外两位老妇交谈。她大概比我们年轻上十岁，肯定没过六十五，衣裙有一部分挡在一盆蕨类盆栽后。她穿着全套修身的丧服，正是时下流行的剪裁，戴着一串小黑玉珠项链，颈上戴着一条随便而迷人的丝绒贴颈项链。我很快弄清了我们的伙伴神游天外的原因。她的头发虽说曾经一定是金色，如今已经是纯白，云鬓蓬松。换做别人的话效果可能滑稽，然而一旦连同考虑到她甜美的面容、蓝灰色的眼睛、热情的微笑还有她时刻准备倾听的习惯，这发式仅仅显得怪诞而可爱。她光着的手中一只宽松的黑手套的指上有个洞，她不断地去摆弄，一意识到自己在摆弄后又停下来。 “福尔摩斯先生，”雷斯垂德声调平板地说。“我需要福尔摩斯先生。事不宜迟，拜托。” “他就在这里。” “福尔摩斯先生。” “是的？”我的朋友问道。 “我需要你来——来那一套。就现在。你总做的那个。” “收获蜂蜜？”福尔摩斯恼火地发问。 “不，不，是那个——那个——你知道，是——” “噢。”福尔摩斯轻柔地暗笑出声。他把手伸进外套内袋，取出眼镜，把镜片推上他弯曲的鼻梁。“唔。没有太多，恐怕。” “告诉我。”雷斯垂德恳求道。 对着拳头咳嗽以掩去他的愉悦，福尔摩斯照做了。“她寡居约有两年了，而她的朋友希望她对这一切别再秉持这么维多利亚式的做派。她显然是法国血统，否则见不着那样颜色的眼睛。还有什么呢……她住在这间酒店方圆一英里——不——两英里之内，是步行来的。虽说她不幸患有轻微的风湿，只是轻微的，不过显而易见。她至少有两条苏格兰梗犬，不超过三条。原谅我，我说不出具体数字，如果我哥哥在他立刻就能知道。她经济独立，又为固定收入所限，负担不起无度挥霍。她极其不喜欢葡萄酒，但祝酒时会喝上一小口香槟。就这么些。” “不可思议。”我高呼道。 福尔摩斯耸耸肩。“简单至极。肯定用不着我告诉你们——” “没错。用不着。”雷斯垂德赞同道，把他的酒杯随手往福尔摩斯空着的手中一塞，走向那漂亮的年轻寡妇。 福尔摩斯和我发愣地目送他大约三秒，然后另寻消遣。这没什么难的，因为克莱夫·斯托克斯交游广泛。我们看人跳舞，品尝餐点，差不多与所有人沉浸在漫无目的的交谈之中，他们谁也没有要求我讲述那些短篇故事的真实版本或是请福尔摩斯在他们的手套上签名。一切棒极了。 “你累了吗？”过了几小时，福尔摩斯问我，一手贴在我的后背，我正目瞪口呆地注视着雷斯垂德在小小的舞池中跳着华尔兹。 “能眼见这么不可思议的事，我怎么会累呢？”我回答。 片刻之后，新婚夫妇偶然经过，饮过香槟微醺而又兴高采烈，无目标地冲每个人微笑。 “您可曾想过要结婚，福尔摩斯先生？”耐德·罗杰斯以一种友善的方式嚷着。“我极力推荐这事儿。” “我同样要向他人推荐婚姻，”我的朋友泰然自若地回答。“我基于个人经验这么讲。” 当晚我们跟欣喜若狂的雷斯垂德告别时，我们取得了他常来拜访的保证。次日上午，在我享用了一顿丰盛的早餐、而福尔摩斯经受了有关乱调别人表的一顿言语鞭挞之后，我们从迈克罗夫特那里索得了同样的承诺。在十一点左右，福尔摩斯吹口哨招来了他瞥见的第一辆马车。伦敦再度从我们身边飞驰而过——漫不经心、居心叵测、不加雕琢，然而美丽如昔。然后我们把包拎在手里，等在火车站台上。四周的空气明晰、静滞、满是污染，我们与其他旅客摩肩接踵。福尔摩斯看上去愉快而安适。 而我不愿离开。 “我们应该更经常回来。旅行对你哥哥而言很困难。”在我们上车时我说，想着毫无进展的手稿、毫无目的的列车以及毫无指望的心愿。 “噢，他办得到的，”福尔摩斯回答，把我们的行李抬到架子上。“这对他有好处。而且他相当喜欢在抵达之后抱怨火车的振动。” “你不会想那里吗？”当他在我对面落座、展开报纸时我轻轻地问。 福尔摩斯抬眼，越过他的眼镜看着我。“伦敦？” “不。贝克街。”我喃喃道。这几个字承载的意义如此深重，使我难以用任何可识别的音量说出口来。 我的朋友摘下阅读用眼镜，用它轻轻地敲着纸页，眼神变得非常温柔。 “我当然想，”他向我保证道。“我怎么能不想念那里呢？” “我是那么的想念它。” “我注意到了。否则你也不会盯着那些手稿，看到心烦意乱也不愿停下来。” 那不是我盯着手稿看的原因，而且有很多年来一直都不是，但我缄默不语。在火车开动时我望向窗外，铁轨之外的草干枯了，其间散落着满城随处可见的砖块、单块水泥和石头。我想起我最近的三篇草稿，其中哪一篇都没有给我丝毫乐趣，读来全都像是对我自己风格的蹩脚模仿。我闭上了眼睛。 “亲爱的？” 我睁开眼。 “你想什么时候回到伦敦，我们就什么时候回来，”他说道，然后再度戴上眼镜，目光重回报纸。“我向你保证——两年是太久了。就算里面有六个月是在巴黎、吃着似乎完全由黄油堆砌而来的食物度过的，我也确实想念贝克街。每一天都是。但我不需要想念你，那才是最重要的。” 他是对的，当然。于是我就想着我招天谴的手稿，默不作声，告诉自己我们是安全的，告诉自己即使我感觉得到风暴的形成，这风暴也永远不会降临。所需一切唯有静默，时间，以及再一个短篇故事。之后再一篇。接着再有一篇。 直到我们在苏塞克斯下车为止，我只祈祷着能写出足够的故事来让自己满意。 次日，长久以来的隐忍不发，导致我们之间发生了一次争吵。那是个蜜色的下午，室外的空气中尽是蜜蜂与苜蓿花粉。打理完他的花园之后，福尔摩斯信步走进屋内，躲避最猛烈的日光。他在我近旁安坐，一如往常，平和而安静地占据着房间的另一边。他喜欢我在他目所能及之处，从不为此显得烦恼或不自然。从他坐的地方我便能嗅到他，嗅到他那没能完全从手上洗去的新鲜的草腥味，嗅到散自他苍白肌肤的新鲜苹果的暖香。当时我正忙着写稿，故事讲的是一个谋杀犯怎样洗劫了厨房、又怎样使他卑劣的罪行看上去像是一桩团伙入侵案。这故事听上去与“格兰其庄园案”别无二致，不过当然是确有其事。我将笔横掷过了客厅时，福尔摩斯正坐在一张矮桌边，把剪报粘进一本大些的剪报册。他抬眼望来，眉头在难以置信中皱了起来。 “抱歉，”我故作轻快地说。“我的眼睛累了。” “你的眼睛没累，”他冷冰冰地回答。“如果你要对我说谎，至少用点心吧。” 我咬紧了牙。有时候，不得不被人一览无余地活着真是不公平。我没有步入圈套，而是去捡我那落在另一边地板上的笔。 “告诉我，我的财产是否在你眼中不知怎地突然变得肮脏了？” 我半道停了下来。“什么？” “肮脏，”他重复道。“污秽。你是否需要某样东西，又不愿花费我的钱财去购买？” “当然不是。”我回答，颇为惊骇。 “你是否同样地蔑视起你自己那数值不容小觑的版税了？” “为什么——” “你可曾从我们共同的账户中侵吞了一大笔钱，正想方设法填补空缺？你有个私生子吗？还是有比从前更加严重的赌瘾？” “不。”我咬牙说道。“你也清楚得很，你是在刻意激怒我。” “我有吗？好吧，如果不是为钱，你一定是为了乐趣而写作的。那么，就这么定了。” 我换了个方向，跌坐在长沙发上，完全精疲力竭。 “我们不要就我的写作争论了，求你，”我恳求道。“我向来都在写作。我需要写作。” 他极度恼怒地把胶刷丢向纸页，站了起来，双手搭在下髋部开始踱步。 “你，”他小心翼翼地说，“常常写作，没错。可你从未逼迫自己像个蓄奴船上的奴隶一般去写，永不休止地做着苦役。那现在是为什么，约翰？为什么？” “写作并不痛苦。”我悲惨地否认着。 “除非你在为某事惩罚自己，而我没看出有这个必要，”他继续道，一指指尖轻敲着嘴唇。“没有谁勒索你要你写更多东西，那未免太荒唐了——有谁这么做吗？你会告诉我的，毋庸置疑。有人勒索你吗？” 我翻了个白眼，完全不知所措。 “那好。”他愉快地总结道。“那么我不准你再写关于我的故事。” 我傻瞪着他，心脏狂跳，勉强吐出一句“不。” “为什么？”他嚷道，挥舞着双手。“我很多年没见你如此心力交瘁了，还恰恰就在我眼前，在我们自己家里。既然写作在我们之间造成了隔阂，既然写作使你跟我可笑地谎称你头痛、眼部疲劳、肩膀不适、手不舒服……那你为什么不停笔呢？告诉我，天啊，求你告诉我，你为什么要对我们做出这种事？我推理不出来，为这个我简直要疯了。停笔吧。” “可我根本无法停笔，”我喘息道。“我无法停止记述你的一切。做不到。” “究竟为什么是该死的不行？华生，这很荒谬。你这样折磨自己又是为了什么？我不是非得每几个月在家庭杂志上现身一回才能知道自己还活着，所以你为什么要——” “因为只要我一直把你写下来，你就不会离我而去。”我哽咽着说。 福尔摩斯半途停下，无声而轻捷地转过身来注视着我。那一刻水晶样明晰易碎，什么都可能使它粉碎。有一会他苍白、轮廓优美的薄唇纹丝不动。 我把脸埋在双手中。 我本来没想告诉他，当然。因为那完全是无稽之谈，到头来只让我觉得自己老糊涂了。 于是，当然，他也发现了。 然后他绵长而静谧的脚步在我身边响起。我的朋友坐到沙发上，胳膊环住我的肩膀，要把我的头贴上他的脖颈突然变得容易多了。 “我必须得写下去，你瞧，”我低语道。“我必须得写。只要我一直写你做的那些绝妙的事，写你无与伦比的为人，你就会不断给我新的内容来写。你会做出新的绝妙之事，而我会把它们写下来，你看，然后就永远这么继续下去。所以不行，我不会停笔。我不在乎写出来之后是糟糕透顶、愚不可及还是毫无新意。那能把你留住。我可以把你留住。如果我停下来，如果我无处将你所做的新的卓尔不群的事昭告于世，那……” “那么我就不在了，不会再给你新的素材了。好了，亲爱的，”他轻喃着，嘴唇落在我的发间。“好了。” 能使我心神不宁的必是极重的负荷，即使如此，我几乎总能尽快重新控制自己，以免困扰我们二人中的任何一个。然而尽管我的双眼干涩如常，可我的手在颤抖，呼吸也无法保持平稳。我们坐在那里，我朋友的手指在我的背部、我的后颈漫不经心地打着圈游走，直至我终于能深吸一口气抬头望向他。当我直遇上他的目光时，他的眼神变得茫然而遥远，如同正破译着为最复杂的密码一般。在很久之前，他常会显出这番模样，而如今已经无须如此了。他的这副表情在我们客厅里再次出现，让我禁不住感到困惑。随后福尔摩斯站了起来。 “跟我来，”他说，伸出一只手。 “福尔摩斯——” “我要向你展示一样东西，医生，现在时机正好。来吧。” 我的头抽痛着。我站起身来握住他的手。也许这纯粹是出于习惯，如今我也说不清了，毕竟一直以来我都这样追随着他，而并非总要有个理由。他牵着我穿过餐厅，途经一间小小的厅室，进了我们的图书室。与我们的办公室不同，图书室设在一楼，仅仅是一个从地板到天花板列满了藏书的小房间。除了两张高背椅、一张小而沉实的桌子、四面墙上摆着的书卷以外，这里什么也没有，连窗户也没有。福尔摩斯是个热切的藏书家，而我是个热切的读者，所以要容纳这些书需要一整间屋子。他劝我随他进去，打开了灯，轻轻扳着我的肩让我转过身，在极长的一排黄皮杂志前站定。 《海滨杂志》。 我不想在那里，也不想看见这些。我的身体变得僵硬，于是我的朋友把双唇靠近我的耳畔，手掌上上下下地摩挲着我的胳膊。 “你不是为你刚刚说出的理由才写下这些东西。不是你自以为的理由：让我一直活着。” “我不是吗？”我厉声说。“那么你，我猜，没有写下它们的你，知道真正的理由？而我，作为真正的作者，反而不知道？” “正是如此。我知道。” “那我一直以来都他妈在干什么？” “把我介绍给我自己。” 福尔摩斯的手松开了我的肩，他退后了大概一英尺，倚在坚实的桌边。他拿出了他的香烟盒跟火柴，懒懒地点了一支烟，扫视着长长一排期刊。其中并不只是《海滨杂志》，也有《科利尔杂志》，还有《利平科特月刊》和《自由杂志》，全都是按着发行的次序排好的。（注）这让我觉得反胃。而且他刚说的话我一个字也不懂，完完全全不懂。逃离的冲动每一秒愈加迫切。（译注：当时爵士的作品是相继发表在上述杂志上。） “我只是想要你知道现在我懂了，”福尔摩斯温和地说，从唇边移去一小片烟草屑。“自从你我相识，我一直对你抱有最好的初衷，然而自从你我相识，从许多形式上讲，我都没能让你快乐。这一事实长久以来令我相信我……我觉得自己是某种危害，你瞧。假设一只豪猪爱上了一只水母，而水母回应了——这样的一对伴侣在一起会造成某些不幸的情况，”他挑起一边嘴角苦笑着，沉吟道。“令人心碎的情况，正如我所做的那样。但一直以来，你从未停止向我展示我真正的为人，而直到近几年我才渐渐明白，你做得着实滴水不漏。你瞧，我并不认为自己是个英雄，从不。我热爱谜团，我的思想折磨我，我情愿这世界能比我童年时所了解的更为公正，即使是破案，我也是为着这些颇为自私的动机。我也会觉得自己仿佛是不断沉沦，约翰，频频如此，似乎是永无止境地沉沦（注）。可我在读你的故事时，我终于能隐约开始觉得我是一个好人。或者，至少，我就是个固步自封、顽固不化、妄自尊大、愚昧无知的混蛋的模样，只要有人足够爱这个混蛋。”（译注：详见系列前篇Birds to a Lighthouse/群鸟飞向灯塔，当时文中引了魏尔伦的诗句。“沉沦”原文falling，Buildmode大大在文中直译为坠落，此处取义译为“沉沦”。） 他停下，吸了一口手中的烟，仍慵懒地注视着那些薄薄的纸质杂志。我很庆幸，因为泪水充盈了我的眼眶，若他给我足够的时间，我就能设法把眼泪眨去。然后他的目光转向我。 “噢，行了，”他温柔地说。“你想不想听听我的一个秘密？” 我点头，说不出话来。 “当我在欧洲大陆逃亡，也就是我躲避着气枪、让你心碎的时候，我读到了《歪唇男人》中有关群鸟飞向灯塔的那一段，你觉得我做了什么？” 我只有摇头。 “我整个下午都哭得像个爱尔兰寡妇。我不得不再买一期，因为我的泪水把原来那本毁了。好了，现在你知道这秘密了。” 对这半是自嘲、半是严肃的供认，我唯一可能的反应就是笑了。于是我大笑起来。我大笑着，发觉自己眼中仍有泪水，但现在的我能够直面自己的作品了，直面我为面前这人写下的千言万语。我对着那一排期刊竭尽全力地笑着，福尔摩斯笑容满面，溜到我身后，拿着烟的那边手臂环过我的肩头，脑袋轻轻地靠着我的头。 “看看这些，”他喃喃道。“想想看有多少人读过这些故事，亲爱的。有多少我不曾谋面的人为我的缺席扼腕，有多少远在天边的人以其他语言读着这些故事，有多少人以后会读到它们，有多少人在嘲笑苏格兰场时会想起我。即使大不列颠人民把这些再读上五十年，我也不会吃惊。你全部的爱与才华集于一处，只为了告诉我，比起我眼中的自己，我更像是你所见的我。这是何等奇妙。” 当我倾身向前去偷吸一口他的烟时，他伸出一根修长的手指一拨，从架子上取下最末一册书。那是《自由杂志》，今年的三月刊。他轻弹一下把杂志翻开。接着，他把杂志举至我们俩眼前。 “这是胶，华生，”他带着兴味读道。“毫无疑问是胶。”（注）（译注：语出《肖斯科姆别墅》，是爵士发表的最后一篇福尔摩斯小说。） 我对这可悲、贫乏、苍白、效仿前作的字句摇着头，又笑了起来。 “我也一样永无止境地沉沦，你知道，”停止笑声后我低语。“只不过对我来说感觉不一样。” “我知道。但就让这成为你的封笔之作吧，约翰，”我的朋友一面把那册杂志塞回去一面提议道。“求你了。一直以来你都费尽心血地讲着我的故事——不对吗？——无论痛苦、欢愉还是其他状态之中，这已足够了。你并不是在让我活着，你已然使我不朽。我永远不会死去。证据就在你眼前。你只需在我身边，避开我的蜜蜂，嘲笑我无论有其他怎样的园艺才能都绝对种不出像样的小萝卜，还有——” 我没能得知他还想要我做什么，因为我在他的臂弯之中转过身去，吻了他。不过可想而知，亲吻最终会出现在这清单之上。他屏住呼吸，然后深深吸气，烟掉落在我们之间，在我们的地毯上缓缓灼出一个滚烫的洞，但我看也没看就胡乱用鞋将它碾灭。我毫不在乎，因为我正同样深切地燃烧着。我发觉，烧坏的地毯对于我们，就像未完成的手稿一样无关紧要。因为他搂在我后背的双臂如此强健，在将来的年岁中也将一直如此，他是我的，也从不曾将自己出借给他人，这么久以来一直属于我，而他就是一切。他是我唯独渴求的一切，而如今他似乎明白了。 他终于明白了。 我气喘吁吁地抽身而出，抬头望着他。“一人一遭很公平，但我一个人做不到。” “抱歉，你说的是？” “我需要你，”我回答。“最后一次葬礼。只要再有这么一次，歇洛克·福尔摩斯，然后我们就跟葬礼彻底撇清关系了。” 我们很快发现，要想挖个坑烧掉我所有未完成的手稿是行不通的。于是福尔摩斯去了我们花园后部的石坑，仲夏之夜我们偶尔会在那里燃起熊熊篝火。有一次，我们在那儿烤了一只鹅，只用刀、盘子与手指作工具便吃掉了它。他点了相当多的柴火，小心地照管着，直到炭变得火红而贪婪，而红日精疲力竭地沉入附近的山后。 要把那些捆起的纸页投入火中，看着它化为灰烬，一开始真的很难，即使有福尔摩斯的手在我的肩头，即使我知道他是对的，知道他会理解我。 但之后那容易了些，然后逐渐变得有趣，接着成了纯粹的欢愉。最后我们站在那里看着成百上千的纸页——恰有二十五个各自成篇、写得蹩脚的短篇故事、小说与独幕剧——飘散在空中，飘向海洋，然后不复存在。 “回屋里去吧。”我的朋友对我说。纸稿消失，星辰乍现，苏塞克斯的夜来得很快，比我住过的其他任何地方都要快。 “今晚我又能干些什么？”我快活地问他，我们一起穿过渐渐隐在黑暗中的花园，经过棚架上蔓生的蜜豆藤，经过一畦畦使空气中充盈着甜香的青菜、胡萝卜、药草和番茄。“既然我不再为劣质文学枉费心机？” “你是自亚历山大大帝以来，第一个使自己的同性恋人永垂不朽的人（注），”福尔摩斯揶揄道。“你会想出些什么的。”【译注：这里是在说亚历山大跟赫菲斯提安。赫菲斯提安是亚历山大的恋人与右辅大臣。有史学家说，亚历山大在赫菲斯定死后剃光自己的头发，还下令将所有军马的毛发也都剪断，并且全面禁止宴会活动，还处死了赫氏的主治医生。此后亚历山大将赫氏的遗体运至巴比伦，于巴比伦发起史无前例的盛大纪念仪式来追悼亡者。亚历山大向西顿有名的神殿请求将赫氏奉为圣人。很多人将赫菲斯定和亚历山大之死联系在一起，因为亚历山大自己在赫氏死后八个月也辞世了。据说亚历山大死后不久，古希腊哲学家们说，亚历山大大帝一生战无不胜，但他打过一次败仗：败在赫菲斯安的两腿之间。”（啧啧。）】 晚饭后，福尔摩斯心不在焉地奏起一支缠绵悱恻的美妙旋律，听上去如同秋日暮色中的伦敦。我读着但丁，又写了两封信，然后便盯着炉火，坐在自己椅子中，陷在靠垫里。有那么一会，我像只猫一般蜷在椅子上，构思着一段我突然想要写下的航海历险，编出了船长、水手和正直的土著人的姓名，让我的思绪流连于阴暗的海域、奇异的营救以及主人公们经受自然与命运考验时所在的小岛。不过说真的，我什么也没做。 而我很快乐。 “那旋律听上去有点像是我们，”几个小时后，我和他一起爬上床时我说道。 “它听上去非常像是我们俩，”他温和地回答，伸手到床头柜上取来眼镜，然后检视起我来。“我已经构思了很多个年头。这曲子几乎快谱完了。” 我微微一笑，问道：“那么，这曲子叫什么？《永世沉沦之徒的挽歌》？” 他爆出一声清晰响亮的大笑。“噢，感谢基督，感谢所有一切，你的黑色幽默又回来了。你可知我有多想念——得了，去他的，如果你愿意，我们就这样给它命名。” 我咬着唇。“不，那不是挽歌。我想要个同义词。” 他眉毛一挑，摘下了眼镜，若有所思地叼着一边眼镜腿的末端。镜框是银色，一如他的头发，我大概第一千次想着，这与他非常相称。我脑中那顽固的传记作家对我说，他从一九二一年开始需要眼镜，他在摄政街买下了这副眼镜。当他第一次戴上眼镜时，你想要吻他，但你不能。于是你拉着他进了一家旧书店，他得戴着眼镜才看得清出版商商标。你在那里盯着他看了四十分钟，而他买了一本译成法语的旧的彼得拉克（注）著作，那书闻起来一股地窖的味道，不过以翠绿皮革装订，十分美观。（译注：意大利学者、诗人，文艺复兴第一个人文主义者，被誉为“文艺复兴之父”。与但丁、薄伽丘齐名。） 这一切我都谙熟于心。但我无需再将之诉诸笔下。我会知道，他会知道，毕竟我们两个都曾亲身经历。 余下的世人再也不必作此见证。 “悼亡曲？” “好一点，”我承认。“不尽人意。” “悲歌？” “从来不是。”我说，全心全意。“从不曾是一曲悲歌。” 福尔摩斯对我面露微笑，那是一个突如其来、热切深情的笑，让他眼角的皱纹在眼周像扇子一样展作无数浅痕。 “颂歌，那么。”他提议道。 “也许吧。” “‘也许’可不够。主题曲。” “乏味。” “练习曲。” “太冷静了。” “礼赞？” “这就是了。”我欢呼道，探向前去，吻起他假笑的嘴角。当他故意躲开时再度探上前去，轻噬着他的下颌。“我就知道你找得到的，我就知道。你又赢了，你是个天才你知道吗？你的才智多么非凡，你聪明绝顶，你不可思议，你是不朽之神，你是——” “够了，”他大笑道，手指轻柔地穿过我的头发。“够了。到这儿来。把灯关上。” -The End- 译后记： 首先要感谢beta跟润色的gn们。文的前三分之一由sn gn初校，后来转给了螃蟹gn，螃蟹gn很认真很细致地校对了全文；润色是sunnyoj gn，许多与日常表达习惯不一致的地方gn都很耐心地做出了纠正。以及配图的arashicat gn。还有邀请我参与Love ‘verse翻译的tsawhb gn，她很辛苦地联系了配图的gn，而且如果没有她的鼓励，我想我做梦也不会敢接下K大的文。 本篇是爱诗篇的收尾之作，尽管可以单独成章，但其中有贯穿全系列的情结与气韵，对前六篇是一种收束。译完这一篇之后感慨万千压在心头，觉得该写点什么，不过谈得太多就露怯了，所以只简单说一点对于全系列的感受。 挑剔是我的习惯，毕竟没有完美的事物，但K大的文美到让我不忍心挑剔，至少这个系列是这样的。如果一定要说有点意见的，大概是两人的感情自始至终都如此浓烈（有了四十年依旧激情不减啊，啧啧），美则美矣，就是浪漫得近乎脱离现实了。不过也许就该是这样？另外个人觉得系列中第一篇稍弱，出色但不是最出色的，然而这篇是必要的，做下一个铺垫，写他们的开始。感觉基调的真正奠定始于第二篇，而重头戏大约是第四篇。（说到这里，想到K大后来的悖论组曲，首篇也是稍次，后而愈加推进愈见其不凡，二者都是布局宏大呢） 为什么这样说呢？因为，正如系列名称所示，七篇文的主题都是“爱”，爱是贯穿始末的，所以重点并不真正在于这段传奇一般的恋情如何开始，而在于这份爱如何存在、如何继续、如何藐视着岁月横跨数十载，在于途中的波折、慰藉、伤害与宽恕，他们都不完美，但在彼此的眼中他们再珍贵不过，两个人的精神与意志完全对等，灵魂契合得严丝合缝，有如一颗心碎成的两片，缺了哪一方都无法完整。这样一种对于爱的探索，也使作品多多少少有了情节之上的东西——爱或许就是如此，纵然外界有过多不可知的因素时时加以干扰，纵然两个人因为彼此性格里无法磨灭的特质难免有意无意之间伤害彼此，历尽坎坷之后仍是至死方休，一段情缘因爱而诗化，因爱而神圣，甚至因爱而不朽（放在爱诗篇的情境里，感觉原著每个短篇都像医生写给侦探的情书），因此从头至尾一直读下来只觉荡气回肠。 翻译中也是对K大的风格有了更深的体会。语言的绮丽是不用说的，已经摘抄了不知道多少，只是解构跟转化她的遣词造句着实困难。我也不敢说还原，能捕捉到一点影子算我能耐。另外怎么才能把生了气的侦探翻得不像闹脾气的小孩子，进而使医生的纠结和愧疚看上去不是小题大做；怎么体现医生长久以来潜在的焦虑，进而把一种难以理出头绪的思绪轨迹或感觉表现得不像谵妄之语……而且当初开的宣传楼里我写了一小段简介，里面说道“哀而不伤”，这是自己的一种体会，不知道有没有谁跟我感觉一样，有时觉得K大看似不经意地点上一句，就能让人心里一疼。（问题在于心情基本愉悦的人大概是写不出这样的文字的，她自己也说过自己是个很容易失衡的人，想想ATB&amp;BC多半就是因为这个坑上了八个月，虽然这么说有些荒唐，但偶尔不免会担心她） 而且，文中有多处细节是与前文呼应的，我一一加了注，也不知道有没有影响阅读……这可以说是K大惯用的一种手法，一个长长的系列中零散而具有标志性的细节就这样信手拈来，环环相扣，比如说沉沦，飞鸟与灯塔，找同义词的游戏，这种延续的细节见证了如此之多的变化，同时本质上依旧相同，于是整个系列显得浑然一体。 想得起来的暂且就这些。 这次对于我也是种很特殊的体验。因为还是新手，受邀来翻K大的文总有些受宠若惊，自不量力接了下来，其余参与的都是大大们，我充其量凑个热闹，分担下一部分工作量吧。自信在英语方面没有太麻烦beta的gn们，令我惭愧的反而是自己的中文，螃蟹gn所作的修订多数是缘于语句不够通顺，而sunnyoj gn非常细致地帮我调整了部分语序，在此再度鞠躬致谢。 当初接这个文的时候，知道原著向冷，而也没有太在意这个问题，只是尽了力总希望有点反馈，觉得好文不该埋没，不过目的事实上不在于此，翻这篇文更像是为了自己。一直是K大的粉，至今只主动跳过一个坑就是她的，翻着文竟然也有种类似朝圣的感觉（当然这么说夸张了点）。如果条件允许，就算没人看也好，很愿意把她剩下的作品都翻出来，无奈水平还是有限，时间也少，现在只有这样了。 全文一稿手译，从去年9月中旬开始，到11月5日手写稿完成（当时惨不忍睹），然后开始打字修文，2月1日电子初稿完成。如今更完了还真的有点舍不得呢…… 以上。 （2015.12.25） 重修这篇文真的感慨万千啊，去年这个时候的我还没敲完电子稿。 全文只是小改，然而对每一个字每一个纠结的地方都是记忆犹新。K大的文字真的太美，而她所写的这样一种奇妙的爱，到现在还能让嚼烂了这篇文的我为之动容。医生的爱使侦探永垂不朽着，按这种思路，那么多后世的读者，乃至我们，都是不知情的见证人，一遍遍玩赏回味着他们的每一个细节，于是这两个属于彼此的人，就在泛黄的纸页里生生不息地鲜活着。","categories":[{"name":"福尔摩斯原著向","slug":"福尔摩斯原著向","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/categories/%E7%A6%8F%E5%B0%94%E6%91%A9%E6%96%AF%E5%8E%9F%E8%91%97%E5%90%91/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Johnlock无差","slug":"Johnlock无差","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/tags/Johnlock%E6%97%A0%E5%B7%AE/"},{"name":"wordstrings","slug":"wordstrings","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/tags/wordstrings/"},{"name":"Katie","slug":"Katie","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/tags/Katie/"},{"name":"翻译","slug":"翻译","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/tags/%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91/"}]},{"title":"【待授翻】Burdens/千钧重荷","slug":"Burdens","date":"2014-08-26T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-06-24T17:25:24.284Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/08/27/Burdens/","link":"","permalink":"https://oxycontin24601.github.io/2014/08/27/Burdens/","excerpt":"作者：cumberpatchcats

原文：http://archiveofourown.org/works/988998 正文： Sherlock从来都不想要孩子。孩子太过调皮。孩子的气味很可笑。孩子总是举着脏兮兮的小手跑来跑去，吸着满是鼻涕的小鼻子到处多管闲事。孩子幼稚，愚蠢，分不清盐酸和水的区别。孩子像狗一样烦人，总是哀求着别人喂他们或者带他们出去玩，其中哪一样Sherlock都绝对不想去做。 John一直想要孩子。孩子身上有一种美。孩子有着可爱纯真的双眼，有着最欢欣的微笑。孩子——以与大人全然不同的方式——热爱冒险，机智，又富有创造力。孩子会在家里帮忙做事，一向能点亮每个人的生活。孩子粘糊糊的，拥抱他们是一种享受，爱他们更是一种享受。 他们刚在一起的时候，谁都没提过要组建一个家庭。等他们签署了相关文件，二人的无名指上都戴上了相同的金戒指，他们谁也没想过要养一个孩子。 所以当一个寡妇惨遭谋杀、她的婴儿被撇在犯罪现场的时候，他们谁都没指望着要抚养他。“他只能到一个孤儿院去。”Lestrade阴郁地告知他们，而John立即发出了抗议。“不！不，我们会带他回家。拜托，把领养文件给我们吧，我们会照顾他。”Sherlock一言不发地抿紧了嘴，直到那时他才明白John有多想要一个属于自己的孩子。 “他叫什么？” “出生证上写着它叫Hamish。” “太巧了！” “没错。” “而且是‘他’，不是‘它’，Sherlock。” “好吧。” 要说Sherlock是个糟糕的父亲，这已经是在美化事实了。 在必要的时候喂养婴儿、给他洗澡的是John。凌晨三点Hamish开始哭的时候起来的是John，虽说Sherlock那时本来就没睡，目光锁在显微镜的目镜上。“我在做实验的时候绝对不能分心，John。”他会以此为借口。“想要这玩意的人是你。” “他不是‘玩意’，他是我们的儿子。”John愠怒地轻声说。作为应答，Sherlock一言不发。 有一次，John说服Sherlock把Hamish抱在怀里。“我要给他冲奶粉，就抱他一分钟，行吗，亲爱的？”然后他直接把孩子推进Sherlock踌躇的双臂。 Sherlock恨透了过程中的每一秒。一被放进Sherlock的臂弯中，Hamish就开始大哭。Sherlock瞄着号哭的婴儿，厌恶地拧歪了脸。 “哦我的天啊，Sherlock！你不能这么抱孩子！” 他们的性生活消失得无影无踪。 “Sherlock。”Sherlock落在John下巴上的吻让他轻喘。Sherlock的臀部碾着他的身侧，意图明确。“Sherlock。”John重复着，捧住他的脸，温柔地推开了他。“不行，Hamish会听到的。” 作为应答，Sherlock咬紧了牙，翻身下了床。 “你去哪儿？”John追问着，两肘撑起了上身。 “我忘了，我还有个实验没做完。”话音未落，Sherlock已经出了房门。 John挫败地长叹一声，跌回床上用一只手臂把脸遮住，抑制住大喊大叫的冲动。 Hamish长成了一个好奇的、不安分的男孩，圆睁的眼睛渴望着冒险，小手永远想摸摸他所见的一切。他最爱说的一句话是“这是什么，爸爸？”，John会把Hamish抱在大腿上，向他解释天为什么是蓝的，飞机为什么不扇翅膀也能在空中飞行，永远不会对回答他的问题感到厌倦。 John去取书——“爸爸，给我读那个讲会说话的火车的故事”——离开房间才一分钟，而他回来的时候，Sherlock的显微镜掉在了地板上，载玻片摔得粉碎。 “Oh，Hamish。”John悄声说，书从他手中滑落，他连忙跑到孩子身边。他抱住Hamish，握住他小小的手，领他远离这一片混乱，以防他用手去碰碎玻璃。“你父亲绝对不会高兴的。” 恰恰在这时候，Sherlock气势汹汹地走了进来，眼中闪着连John都没见过几次的愤怒。发现他珍贵的科学仪器摔在地上，他对着Hamish拧紧了眉头。他大声喊着，“你怎么敢！”，高举起手，仿佛要狠狠给他一耳光，但John挡在了他们中间。 “他只是在玩而已！” “你知道我不允许他碰我的东西！”Sherlock厉声说。 John把Hamish抱在怀里护住他。“啊哈，也许你不该把你这堆垃圾在屋子里放的到处都是！” Sherlock摇着头，手在身侧紧紧攥成拳头，他的整个身体因为暴怒而颤抖。“把那孩子弄出去。” “他是我们的儿子！” “你的儿子。”Sherlock的话不经大脑就出了口。John的表情在他眼前由震惊变为难以置信。这是Sherlock声称在世界上最爱的人，而他才意识到自己深深地伤了他的心。然而他的天性不容许他道歉。他张开嘴，似乎想说些什么，最终把嘴闭紧转身离开了。 Hamish再也没有问过父亲到底会不会来学校接他。 “他很忙。”John说，整理着Hamish的领子。 “不，他不忙。他讨厌我。” John无奈地对儿子微笑，揉揉他的头发。“他当然不讨厌你。你父亲只是不知道怎么应付孩子。” Hamish怀疑地盯着爸爸，然后摇了摇头。“他讨厌我。” “嘘。”John轻轻地拍了一下他的额头。“别说话。” Hamish兴高采烈地回了家。“看啊，爸爸！”他叫着，挥舞着一张纸。“我得了班里的最高分！Mrs.Danni说她想给我留三年级的功课！” 但是John在诊所上班，屋里只有Sherlock。 Hamish勇敢地咽下不安，迟疑地向父亲走过去。“看，父亲。”他小声说，举着他骄傲的成果。 “现在不行。”Sherlock回答。“别来烦我，我很忙。” “好吧。”然后年轻的男孩儿无声地走开了。 John回家之后，给了Hamish一个大大的拥抱，把他出色的成绩站在了冰箱上。 “Sherlock，你连试试都不行吗？” “看在上帝份上，这难道还是我自找的！” “你本来可以说不行的！但是你没有！你闭紧了你该死的嘴巴，就这么默许了，现在你让我们谁都很不好过！” “我想让你开心！” “想让我开心并不需要一个孩子！我本来只需要你！” “你一直想要一个家庭。”Sherlock辩解着。 “能有个家庭当然更好不过了，没错，但是现在，我们现在这样，绝不是一个家庭。这是我在照顾我的——我们的儿子，因为你自愿签了领养文件，你知道。你甚至都没试过让他融入你的生活！你知道他是班里第一名吗？你知道上周他去踢球的时候踢进了吗？你知道他一直跟我说他长大了有多想做一个像你一样的科学家吗？你甚至了解他吗？” 有那么一会，Sherlock一言不发。他面无表情地看着他的电脑，仿佛John一个字都没说。最终他开了口。“我正在工作，不能分心。” John挫败地举起了手。“我放弃了。”他宣称。“我不管你了。” 当然，就在楼上，有个小男孩把被单蒙在脸上，每一个字都在他耳朵里回响。 那次车祸不是任何人的错。 天本来就很晚了，加上天气多雾，John没有看见车，开车的司机也没看见他。司机事后道了歉。不幸的是，有时最诚挚的歉意也无法抚慰任何伤痛。 他们找Sherlock去辨认遗体。他没有哭。 他在葬礼上也没有哭。 Hamish还差一点满十三岁，他连着哭了几周。对他来说，他基本是再次成了孤儿。 Sherlock渐渐沉沦。 Hamish眼看着他的合法监护人叼着香烟把针头刺进皮肤。如今Hamish负责他们两个。还没上九年级的他要做晚饭，还要清理Sherlock留下的一团乱。毕竟John从来不喜欢屋子里乱糟糟的。偶尔，Sherlock会搁下一大笔钱给他，Hamish会默默把钱拿去购物。 “Mish，我们去你家学习吧。” “哦，这可不是个好主意。我们家有不少蟑螂。” Hamish从来没见过父亲哭泣。但有的时候，如果他仔细去听，他会在夜很深、很深的时候隐隐听见回荡在走廊里的啜泣声。 “Mish，我们去你家做作业怎么样？” “最好不要，我们家管子坏了。” “天，你们家总得出点毛病，是不是？” “他不好意思。”另一个男孩插嘴说。“因为他爸是个肮脏的毒虫。” “闭嘴！”Hamish尖刻地吐出这么一句，尽可能快地逃开了人群，滚热的愤怒在他的血液中沸腾。 Hamish从来不会着急回家。不过今天是购物的日子，也就是说家里会有一些钱等着他去取。他一般会跑去超市，挑一些他喜欢的东西——反正Sherlock也不在乎他们吃什么——然后尽快回家做作业。然而今天没有钱。餐桌上空空如也，Hamish一晚上什么都没吃。 第二天他也没找到钱。Hamish回家的时候，他的父亲瘫倒在沙发上，依旧穿着浴袍，high上了天。 Hamish勇敢地咽下不安，迟疑地向那毒瘾者走过去。“父亲。”他温和地哑声说，这也许是他这一年里第一次在自己家里开口。“我们没有吃的了。” Sherlock花了五分钟才翻身滚下沙发，萎靡地拖着步子进了他的卧室。过一会他拿着一个纯黑的皮质钱包走了出来。他从里面抽出几张纸币递给年轻的男孩。Hamish从容地接了过来。 Hamish大胆地抬起头看着他的父亲，看着这堕落的天才。Sherlock的眼中除了伤痛和空虚以外空无一物。当他从Sherlock伸出的手中接过钱时，他瞥见了依旧戴在Sherlock左手无名指上的金戒指，虽说戒指环在他变细的手指上已经松动了。Hamish笨拙地清清嗓子。“您……您应该休息一下。” Sherlock没有回答，甚至没有承认他的存在，只是转身栽倒在沙发上，倒作骨瘦如柴的一团。 那天晚上，Sherlock用他的旧小提琴拉起最忧伤的旋律，Hamish伴着音乐陷入沉眠。 “Hamish，你父亲虐待你吗？” Hamish直盯着指导老师的眼睛，坚决而不容置疑地告诉她，“不。” Sherlock把John的旧电脑架在腿上打着字，因为他自己的电脑离得太远了，他懒得去拿。当Hamish从学校回家的时候，他丝毫没有间断。 Hamish很快看见了John的电脑。毕竟他一点都不笨。Sherlock的脸苍白而憔悴，深陷的双眼变得阴暗。他手指上的戒指甚至比以前更松了。Hamish从来没见过谁比他父亲更像个瘾君子。Sherlock咳了起来。 “父亲。”Hamish紧张地说。“你看上去很不好。” Sherlock打字的手指一下没停。 Hamish又试了一次，走近了他那所谓的父亲。“也许你该睡——” 他的手碰到Sherlock肩膀的时候，Sherlock立刻站了起来，死死抓住Hamish的手腕，拽过男孩的头顶，Hamish惊叫了一声。然后Sherlock的手扇过他脸的力度让他摔在了坚硬的地板上。摔倒和挨耳光一样疼。 Hamish惊喘着，手当即捂住疼痛的脸颊。他以一种前所未有的惊恐神态抬头看着Sherlock。Sherlock干过很多事，他把他的实验放任不管，把他能找到的任何毒品注进自己的血管。他无视Hamish，但他从来，从来没有打过他。 当Sherlock对上Hamish的目光，恐慌的男孩向后退去，似乎在怕Sherlock会再一次下手打他。榛褐色。Hamish的眼睛是榛褐色。Sherlock能看见那圆睁的双眼里灼烧的恐惧。Sherlock之前从未想起过，那恐惧之下是纯然的无辜。Sherlock的举动甚至惊到了他自己。他以前从来没有打过他。有一次，很久之前，他几乎落下手了，那时候Hamish不站在他的小凳子上都够不到水池。如果那时候没有John阻止他，他会下手的。Sherlock猜这一回John本也会阻止他打他的——他们的儿子的，如果……如果John愿意费心出现的话。 然后他的泪水就流了下来，顺着他的脸留下来，即使他拼尽全力想让它留在眼眶里。他面前是一个无辜的男孩，一个孩子，他的孩子，从来也没有逃离他的身边，哪怕他早就该这么做了。他比任何同龄的孩子都面对过更多次死亡。而Sherlock在过去的十四年里一直在忽视这个孩子。 Sherlock抬起手臂挡住了眼睛，挡住了视线，因为他无法继续注视那双纯真的、疼痛的眼睛。他转身背向Hamish，肩膀开始颤抖。 Hamish盯着他看了一会，难以决定接下来该怎么办。最终他慢慢把手从刺痛的脸上挪了下来，深深吸了一口气。 “你还爱他吗？爸爸，我是说。” Sherlock粗哑的笑声几乎被眼泪噎了回去。“很不幸，是的。” “你爱我吗？” Sherlock一下转过身来，面向地上的男孩，他们的视线再次相遇。Hamish的问题让他措不及防。十四年，他甚至没有认真看过他儿子的脸。Hamish已经长成一个相当好看的男孩，Sherlock无法否认。他不禁想，如果John还在，还在照顾Hamish，他将会变成一个多么英俊的年轻人。 “妈的。”Sherlock嘶声说，脸埋进了双手。“我跟我哥哥说过要他把你带走。我跟他说，要照顾一个孩子我根本应付不来。他说你需要一个父亲，每个男孩都需要一个父亲。我糟糕透了。我对你糟糕透了而且——看看我对你做了什么，我在虐待你。他们应该逮捕我然后把我锁在监狱里。你需要一个父亲，一个真正的、合适的父亲，不是像我这样的瘾君子。”话一出口，Sherlock跪倒在他的儿子面前，放声而哭。 他的话让Hamish难以招架。也许看见他父亲的这一面比挨打还要可怕。他无疑隐约听见过Sherlock崩溃，但他从来没亲眼见过这一切。他从来没见过父亲在他面前完全瓦解的样子，头埋向地面，双肩随着每一声抽泣剧烈地颤抖。 “父亲……”Hamish轻声说，伸出了手，但还是不敢触碰那破碎的人。他把手收回身侧，只是静静地看着他。 他们就那么坐了很长时间。Sherlock哭到眼泪流尽，而当他停下来，他没有动，低头盯着地板，不敢看Hamish的眼睛。 这一次，Hamish设法鼓起一点勇气，扶住了父亲的肩膀，轻缓地让他直起身来。Sherlock因为这触碰缩了一下，但还是没有躲开。 他们再次凝望着彼此的眼睛。“父亲，”Hamish神情严肃地说。“你爱我吗？”他把之前的问题重复了一遍，渴求一个答案。 作为应答，Sherlock忧伤地摇了摇头。接着，他慢慢地开了口。“我……我可以试试。” 这几个字已经足够让Hamish号啕大哭，他不禁紧紧抱住了他的父亲。这举动使Sherlock震惊地僵住了。然而，渐渐地，他发现自己放松下来，甚至迟疑地抬起手抚摸Hamish的头发，当然，这让Hamish哭得更凶了。 Sherlock对于父亲的职责一无所知。但为了这个孩子，他可以去学。 Sherlock从来不想要孩子。孩子难以管制，经常失控。孩子喜欢重复几句话，太容易被踩到。孩子一沾酒就醉，不会计算反应速率，不会给出租司机付钱。孩子说话尖声尖气，他们的手永远又黏又脏。孩子太容易生病，时时刻刻要求你去爱。 但孩子纯洁，聪明而可爱。孩子会给你最棒的拥抱和最可爱的赞美。孩子真的知道怎么按摩才能去掉你后背的痛点，而且他们知道怎么做出世界上最甜蜜的柠檬水。孩子拥有好奇的大眼睛，以及能够让你热泪盈眶的微笑。孩子能戒掉最重的毒瘾，帮你承担失去一生挚爱后心中的千钧重荷。 Sherlock从来不想要孩子，但这不意味着他不为自己有个孩子而感到幸运。 -The

Sherlock转身面向他，陈述事实般地轻声说：“John。”这时水已经淹上了John的胸骨——或者说，没过了Sherlock的腰，这取决于你怎么看。 他像没有听到一样。他没有停下来，继续用全身的重量撞击着困住他们的铁笼笼门，即使他的肩膀发出了一种可怕的嘎吱声，即使疼痛穿透了他右侧身体。他不停地踢打着捆住铁栏的沉重铁链，被一把更重的扣锁锁在一起的铁链，即使它们已然没入他看不见的水底。他不断慌乱扫视着他们空荡荡的囚笼，希望能找到什么东西——任何不是铁链和锁的东西。 当水淹到了他下巴的时候——或者说，没过了Sherlock的肩膀，这取决于你怎么看——Sherlock拉住了他，制止他对锁链和扣锁无用的踢打，一只手臂裹住他疼痛的肩膀，手则围住他的颈后，让他们两个紧挨在一起。那是个过于匆忙、寓意过深的告别，让他挣扎起来，从Sherlock的紧抱之中稍稍退缩， 抬起头来，以一种多半像是反抗的表情望着Sherlock。Sherlock只是直直地、默然地看着他，眼睛几乎一眨不眨，但他动了，双手停在John脸的两侧，拇指轻抚着他的太阳穴。 讽刺得近乎残酷，只要有一只发夹，Sherlock能在任何情况下把锁撬开，用时绝不超过30秒。然而他们只有身上穿着的衣服和Sherlock的手机。他们追捕的人聪明地带走了他的外套和Sherlock的大衣，但究竟没聪明到检查Sherlock的西装内袋、拿走手机。那种使他们次次绝处逢生的疯狂幸运再度降临。 他们给Mycroft打了电话，当然，在他们意识到情况危机之后立刻就打了，唯一的问题是Mycroft在伦敦，而他们不在。他们自己跑去了一个位于一个小海湾的乡村地带，结果被关在一艘缓缓沉没的、叫做弗里斯兰号的渔船上【注1】，在甲板之下的一个铁笼里。他们离得太远了。 水完全没顶后，一切变得悄无声息，他们悬浮在水中，头顶擦过笼顶的铁栏。水质稍浑，灼着他的双眼，但他依旧分辨得出Sherlock眼睛的颜色，清清楚楚。他们屏住呼吸，紧盯着彼此的双眼。Sherlock的手依旧把在他的头侧，拇指仍抚着他的太阳穴。他攥着Sherlock的西装，不让他远离自己。 他的肺在尖叫，在燃烧，无用的气体钻出他的嘴冒成气泡。Sherlock的双手一下紧按住他的颅骨，眼中的恐惧开始吞噬一切。他完全能理解，他也深切地痛惜他即将失去的一切。他即将失去他的人生，他的家人，他尚未降生的女儿，而他还会失去Sherlock。没有丝毫合理性可言，但是知道Sherlock也会和他一起死去，让一切都变得更糟糕了。他败给自己，还是没能救下Sherlock的性命。他的视野变得模糊，边缘变暗，他肺中的气体和Sherlock的一起逃入水中，就在这时，水底突然的震动使他一惊。有两个潜水员到了水下。他竭力克制住吸气的欲望。那些潜水员带着某种设备，一秒就弄断了锁住笼门的铁链。笼门被拽开，有手伸来把他们拉近，把冒着气泡的呼吸器递到他们面前，然后拖住他们，拖出了笼子，拖离了水面。 他垮倒在粗糙的沙上，顿时开始躲闪伸向他的那么多、那么多只手，翻过身来，搜寻着Sherlock，发现他就躺在自己身边，咳嗽，干呕，但绝对还活着。 “给他们点空间。”Lestrade厉声命令着，每个人都收手退开，让他们调整呼吸，留他们独自躺在一小片深色的沙滩上，在月光下目不转睛地凝视着彼此的双眼。 浪潮在他意识边缘永不停歇地击打着沙滩，他们被不同的救护车载离现场之后，那声音还在他脑海中回响。 …… 回想起来，他这辈子做过最残忍的事，就是让Sherlock隔着Mary圆滚滚的肚子感受胎儿的踢动。 他催Sherlock上前，手按在Sherlock后背推了一下。Sherlock几乎向前绊了一跤，回过头来恶狠狠地瞪了他一眼，深吸一口气，然后才展开手掌贴在Mary的腹部。 令人惊叹而又是意料之中，Sherlock以十足的优雅完成了整个过程，近乎荒谬，仿佛他生来就只知道怎么把手抵在孕妇的肚子上。在Sherlock感觉到孩子的踢动时，整个从容的幻象分崩离析。他跌跌撞撞地退了一步，圆睁的双眼注视着John。John向他回以微笑，一切可笑地发晕。Sherlock的注意力很快转回Mary和她的肚子，仅仅说了一句话。“又一次。” 回想起来，他这辈子做过最残忍的事，就是让Sherlock把手摊平在Mary圆滚滚的肚子上，感受胎儿的踢动。 婴儿是死胎，她娇小，了无生气，却又那么美。 Sherlock为之心碎，无可置疑，他伤心欲绝。 至于他自己，他被来自弗里斯兰号的回忆无情地击中，水没过他的头顶、挤出他肺中最后一点空气时，一切陷入了全然的静默。只是这一次，那静默久久不能消散。 Mary变得死气沉沉。她的一切都静滞下来，他已经无从得知她的想法和感受。她在全然的静滞中继续着日常生活。她设法在静滞中延续着一切，工作，购物，与邻居闲聊。这样的平静带着某种美感，流畅，超然，像被注入生命的大理石塑像，毫无瑕疵，完全找不到裂纹。他完全不知道该怎么帮她， 这让他濒于崩溃。 …… 他去看心理医生，这起了点作用，虽说几近微不足道。Mary完全不接受心理治疗。她说：“我为什么要那么做？”表情纹丝不变，几乎超然世外。 他们完全疏离了。 Mary平和、镇静而超然，他则混乱不定，精神的痛苦让他难以忍受自己。结果，面对Mary有关诊所、病人和晚餐的对话，他只能吐出几个唐突的词作为应答，直到他再也无法承受，选择了逃离。 在他毫不犹豫地逃开之前，他有一次问过Mary，为什么她一定要装作什么都没发生过。 她说：“我并没有装作一切都没发生。”“那你现在究竟在做什么？”“我必须要做点什么吗？”“你完全把自己封闭起来了。我完全不知道你怎么了。”“我什么事都没有。”“Mary，求你。这对你来说不可能好受，这——这一切——不管这是什么。”“我还以为我们都已经知道我是精神变态了。你是个医生，John，用用脑子。” 他不知道这是不是她的应对机制，他不清楚，这完全击垮了他。 …… Sherlock对情感的表露前所未有地坦率，John惊讶地发现没有什么比这更给他慰藉了。他本以为他会招架不住，以为另一种哀伤他不会理解，只会放大他的痛苦。 事实恰恰相反。每一次John疲惫无奈地出现在贝克街时，Sherlock眼中毫无掩饰的悲伤和写在他脸上的痛苦，恰恰是他需要的。在Sherlock身边，他觉得从来不需要压抑自己的情感，也从来不必为自己的疲惫和伤痛羞耻。 他问过Sherlock一次，他这样出现，完全一团糟，会不会让Sherlock感到困扰。令他震惊的是，Sherlock径直向他大步走来，紧紧抱住了他，一遍又一遍地重复着，“我很抱歉，John，我很遗憾。”当Sherlock放开John、抽回身去的时候，他的眼睛变得湿润红肿，直直地望着John。Sherlock理解他，他表露无遗的忧伤意想不到地缓和了他的痛苦。 如果他逃离，他只会逃去一个地方。 也许Sherlock甚至比他自己更理解他的感受。 “这不公平。”Sherlock的声音沙哑破碎。“我甚至没有见过她。我完全不该——想念一个你从没见过的人本该是不可能的。这不公平。”“确实。确实不公平。”他也只能说出这么几个字，这只在Sherlock死后发生过。Sherlock坐立不安，仿佛想逃出自己的躯体。John知道那是什么感觉，他清楚，清楚得远远超出了他自己以为的程度，哪怕在一连串噩梦之后。“我爱她。这怎么可能呢？我甚至没见过她，这怎么可能呢。这不该……不该……我爱她。这不公平。这不公平。”这怎么不可能，这已经发生了。他闭上双眼，没有擦去掉下脸颊的泪水。他也爱她。 …… 他走着走着突然停住了，意识到他实际上已经恢复过来，他已经很多天没有再想起这件事了。季节变换了不止一次，而Sherlock和他正处在他们接过的——就他所知——最可笑、最荒谬的案子之中。 一个隐居的业余古董收藏家（一个神经质的妄想狂）和他受尽精神折磨的女儿来到了贝克街。收藏家想让他们帮忙找出第三个姓Garrideb、过了十八岁的人，他的女儿只想让他们帮忙说服她父亲一切只是个招惹祸患的可笑阴谋，而不是一次赚钱良机。收藏家对这个美国堪萨斯来的神秘律师诚挚而难以动摇的信任滑稽至极，为了催他离开，Sherlock假装正经地向他担保他会查明一切，收藏家的女儿给了他一记白眼。他暗示说，不论他们的委托人有多怪异，这么刻薄都不太合适。Sherlock嗤之以鼻，遣散了他的良心不安，一小时之内化名John Garrideb的冒牌美国律师就坐进了他们的客厅，Sherlock用一系列详尽而混乱的谎言慢慢引他上钩。一切进展顺利，然而这假冒的美国人似乎还是很入戏的，他突然掏出枪来，扣动扳机打中了John。只是个擦伤，而且只算表层擦伤，不过在他们弄清楚之前，Sherlock已经以可怕的速度击昏了那人，冲到了他的身边，划开他的牛仔裤以评估伤势。他永远忘不了Sherlock脸上的表情。 “John！你没事吧？”他靠着墙，腿一软，相当不优美地滑坐到地上。Sherlock冲向他，支住他一部分重量。“John，看在上帝份上！告诉我你没事！”“只是皮肉伤而已，没什么。没事的，Sherlock。”即使是当时，他也相当确信他的自我诊断，但Sherlock一个字也听不进去，在他的裤腿上割开一大块，露出子弹擦伤的地方。伤口在流血，但比起其他的可能性简直不算什么。Sherlock抖着，深深松了一口气。“表皮擦伤。”“我说过了。”Sherlock抬头望向他，双眼圆睁，满含惊惶，嘴唇颤着，血色褪尽。他从来没见过Sherlock这个样子。赤裸的情感与恐惧展露无遗，他突然看到了什么，幡然醒悟。他们所想的是一样的。Sherlock的表情所蕴含的一切，与他深埋心底的情感如出一辙。然后Sherlock的唇轻轻贴在他的前额上，简短而猛烈。“我会杀了他。”考虑到Sherlock的语气，如果没人来阻止他，他恐怕真会这么做的。John拽住他的大衣，明确地告诉他不能制造一起命案。 …… 他没法忘掉Sherlock脸上的表情。他看到了些什么，回想起来，他似乎早就该发现了。Sherlock爱他。专一固执，对其他一切全然不顾。他的痛苦和心碎绝不只是为了John未曾降生的女儿。他现在明白了。 他不善言辞，一直都是。当他的话承载着情感时尤其如此。即便他最近看了过多的心理医生，即便他有关Sherlock的温柔彻悟历历在目，他依旧如此。那么就行动，他下了决心，行动才是他擅长的领域。似乎Sherlock也是一样。 他到了贝克街，走上楼梯，走进门去。Sherlock站在餐桌边，用一把手术刀切着什么。Sherlock抬头，向他打招呼，手术刀顿时被抛在一边。他绕过桌子，走向Sherlock，缓缓地、小心翼翼地抱住他，脸埋向Sherlock的脖颈。“John？”“我爱你。”回想起来，这三个字直接脱口而出，即使是那般朴实无华，那般直白坦然。“啊。”一声小小的、了然的感叹。John知道，Sherlock推断出他自己在Garrideb的案子里漏了馅——这取决于你怎么看——而John已经探知了事实真相。Sherlock并没有其他的反应，John退开一点，抬头注视着那双陷入犹疑的眼睛。“为什么你一直什么都不说？”话一出口，John就明白了自己为什么宁可选择行动而不是言辞。他在这方面毫无智慧可言，从来辞不达意。John深深庆幸Sherlock并没有在意。在很多方面，Sherlock对他远比他意识到的要宽容。“很显然。”Sherlock淡然的语气立刻被自己的眼睛背叛了。“错误的性染色体。据某些人所信，这事关重大。”他竭力保持镇静。“性染色体很无聊。”Sherlock回以微笑，然而简短迟疑。他挺起胸来，深吸一口气，这回他看着Sherlock。“我爱你。”Sherlock低头藏住了自己的表情，轻轻摇了摇头。“John……”他打断了他，说出了他早就该说出口的话，他希望Sherlock明白，这也是他欠他的。“我属于你，如果你想要这样。”他的话让Sherlock猛地抬起头来。疼痛再度刻入Sherlock的表情，他脱口而出：“我当然想要，”接着深吸一口气，片刻之后再度开了口。“只是……还有……”John知道他想说什么。Mary。“没错。”他点头。“简直一团乱。”他觉得糟糕透顶，但他早已习惯糟糕的感觉，习惯得没法在乎了。“我们需要找个地方，”他继续说，“我们三个，用成人的方式坐下好好谈谈。” …… 他先单独和Mary谈了谈，当然。否则简直对不起Sherlock，这不是他的错。Sherlock从没指望过陷入这样的局面。如果他不这么做，也一样对不起Mary。 “我们并不幸福。”他开头说。“确实。”Mary赞同着。“我们都不幸福。”他们都知道她指的不只是他们两个。Mary没什么反应，她听着他说话，一动不动，平静得几乎有点吓到了他。等他们谈完很久之后，等到他泡的茶完全凉掉之后，Mary静滞的面具渐渐开裂，变为一种近乎绝望的的东西。他只是看着，手足无措，心痛不已。她颤抖着深吸几口气，盯着天花板。“我没法忍受这一切。我受不了这个国家。这儿的一切都让我想起——我承受不了。我真的不行。”自始至终这是Mary表露出的唯一的情感。他不知道他更为哪一点震惊，是她的情感外露，还是她说话时隐约的美国口音。他握住Mary的手，她轻轻攥了一下。“我试着在这里过的生活，并没有……”她望向他。“并没有起作用，John。”“如果你重操旧业，会安全吗？”他问，猜测她是在说她想要这么做。“足够安全了。”他确信她没有说真话。 …… 不久之后的某天早上，他起床走进厨房，发现桌上有个纸条。 我很抱歉，John。我真的很抱歉。 Sherlock说他应该搬回贝克街。 “你真不介意？”他问。“别傻了。”Sherlock当即反驳，清了清嗓子，视线不确定地从他身上转移向别处。他最近养成了这么个习惯。“反正你大多数时间都呆在这儿。”的确。他差不多已经搬回贝克街，搬回他以前的卧室里了。 卖掉房子简直容易得惊人。一个名叫Bertrand Vernet的人甚至没来看一看就把它买了下来。【注2】 …… Sherlock只在绝对必要的时候看着他，即便如此，也只是时有时无的一瞥。这习惯性的动作让他心痛。 一个昏暗的夜，他压下疑虑和迟疑，在坐在扶手椅里的Sherlock面前屈下身来，双手谨慎地放在他的膝盖上，自己挤进他两膝之间。很久以来的第一次，Sherlock平和而严肃地望着他。在忽闪的火光里，他吻了Sherlock，风雨击打着贝克街的窗。Sherlock急切地回吻，但没有惊讶，也没有疑虑，他拽他向前，最后他们笨拙地挤在了椅子里。他借着这片刻的、陌生的身高优势让Sherlock仰过头去，舌头舔入对方的口腔，但Sherlock绝不会败下阵来，最终，以一声窒息的呻吟、气喘吁吁地断开了这个吻的不是Sherlock，而是他。Sherlock的焦点转向他的脖颈，双手缓慢、从容地游走在他的后背，一路向下，在他的屁股上流连，直到他拉扯起Sherlock的头发，带他沉入另一个吻，比起之前更加舒缓和慵懒。这一次他因为Sherlock退开而发出了不情愿的声音。Sherlock注视着他。John自己也绝不感到惊异，而当他说，“你属于我。”那是个陈述。“是的。当然是。”Sherlock的眼中满是奇妙的暖意，John跳得飞快的心跌跌撞撞打乱了节奏。Sherlock抬头向他微笑，温和，小心，手指穿过他的发间，停在他的颈后。“那么现在我们扯平了。”

Sherlock按响门铃，手握着红酒瓶，拇指的指甲落在封箔与瓶颈的交界，不安地等待着。他没有等很久。来应门的John脸上挂着一个明亮的微笑。“Sherlock！快进来！”他双眼周边布满了笑纹，虹膜闪着光，而Sherlock，在John微微一歪头之前，甚至没意识到自己一直在盯着他看。“或者你也可以留在外头，晚餐准备好了我会给你带一盘过来。”Sherlock摇摇头，尽量彬彬有礼地迈进门槛。“没有这个必要。”他说，挤出一个微笑，希望John能对此一带而过。John指指他手中的酒瓶，于是Sherlock僵硬地把它递了出去。“我记得这是你从前最喜欢的。”Sherlock说。但那以后有多少东西变了呢？这还是他最喜欢的吗？也许John的最爱在过去的两年内变成了其他的酒。“谢了，”John说。“ 我去把它打开，让它透透气。Mary在厨房里就快忙完了。”他把瓶子放在茶几上。“不过先把你的大衣给我，我把它放到书房去。”Sherlock脱了大衣、解下围巾，把它们递给John。John把衣物折起搭在手臂上，又拿起酒瓶，走出了房间。满屋弥漫着意大利千层面和蒜香面包的气味，烘热醉人得几乎令人窒息。Mary在厨房里问好，并没有出来。Sherlock简短地回应，检视着基本米黄的客厅，想不通John Watson为什么会有一个这样的家。客厅整洁，时尚，宽敞而现代。 除了一侧墙上繁复的壁纸之外没有明显带花纹的东西。不像贝克街，这里的东西是刻意放置的，买来就是为了相互协调，使两套归属不同的物品互相融合。他能清楚地看出哪些属于John，哪些属于Mary——沙发厚重的布料（John），尝试着配合并添入一分女性柔和的靠垫（Mary），深色座灯简明的线条和茶几（John），还有玻璃柜面橱柜的把手上挂着的突兀怪诞的小星星（Mary）。书架上的书只有一半被翻开过，架子上还摆着一只罗盘和一座小钟，刻意做旧，实际远没有看上去年代久远。表在运行，罗盘已经不能用了。地毯新用吸尘器清理过，一尘不染。茶几上，电视遥控器中间按钮的印字几乎完全磨去了。当John回来时，他举着两只酒杯——是白葡萄酒，而不是Sherlock带来的红酒。“Mary说我们应该把红酒留到晚餐的时候。”“谢谢。”Sherlock说，接过John递来的杯子，呷下一口，酒味清淡，几乎尝不出什么味道。他啜下另一口。 Sherlock不知道能说什么，于是跟在John的身后。John坐在沙发上，他就坐进扶手椅。“有没有，呃，大象的案子有什么进展吗？” Sherlock皱起眉头。“没有，所有的线索都在那儿，只是我没法把他们拼凑起来。”“唔，我肯定你很快就能找到答案。”Sherlock不置可否地“嗯”了一声，可以被解读成任何意思，算是转移话题，但他不在乎。 他在这间屋子里没法想着工作（没法思考）。他的大脑变成一片米黄，就像当前围住他的几面墙。就在这时，Mary从厨房进来，手拿着自己的那杯酒，手一拂把头发扫出她的视线。“抱歉，”她说，咬着嘴唇。“花的时间比我期望的要久。”她转向Sherlock，露出微笑，俯下身来在他脸上落下一吻。“见到你真好，Sherlock。”“Hello，Mary。”Sherlock说。她指甲下有面粉，衬衫前襟沾了几点酱汁。她坐在沙发上，在John旁边，腿蜷在身下，靠向John。John把酒杯换了只手，以便能空出来一只手搂住她。他的拇指在她肩上转着小小的圈儿，弄皱了衬衫。而Sherlock看见她半闭着眼贴向John的触摸。当她举起手来裹住他的，她的订婚戒指恰好在灯光下一闪，折出明亮的光。Sherlock饮下一口酒。她开始谈论婚礼——初步计划，可能的场地，花店，蛋糕店，宴席，婚纱。Sherlock自己也开始对各个场地做了点研究，所以他自然而然地跟她（他们）一起细数各个地方的利弊。这个太敞开了，那个太闷，这个不置办露天宴席，那个提供桌椅。他们被厨房里“叮”的一声打断，Mary跳了起来。“千层面好了。”晚餐时，Sherlock听John讲起他和Mary如何相识，他们糟透了的初次约会，进展极其顺利的第二次。他看着John说话时面部的线条，看着John望向Mary时不加遏制的爱意，胃里一阵翻腾。他吞下一点沙拉，又喝了一口酒。沙拉没起什么作用，但酒帮了点忙。酒成功地让他微微麻木，变得稍有些迟钝，让他不必把一切尽收眼底——每一个微笑，John说话的时候碰到的Mary身上的每一处（她的手，她的胳臂，她的腰，她与他相碰的膝盖），Mary回触的每个地方（他的肩膀， 他的颈后，他的脸颊）。他或许看到了这一切，但是（他告诉自己），酒精让他不必时刻观察，让他不必去解读那一切的含义。不必解读这对他意味着什么。他喝完了杯中的酒，让Mary再倒给他一杯。保持安静很容易，反正他也没什么可说的。Mary收拾碗盘的时候把他们赶出了厨房，于是Sherlock和John回到了客厅里他们先前的位置。 John倒给他一杯威士忌，他们在相对的安静之中对饮。从厨房隐隐传来自来水声和餐具瓷碟相碰的声音。但忽略那声响很容易，他可以聚焦于当前，他口中烟一般浓厚的味道（让他想要抽烟），John唇边放松的微笑，他眼中的专注（完全投射在Sherlock身上），他们呼吸中的平和，他们没有相碰的脚（但近在咫尺）。他们没有交谈（但是，哦——但是他们确实在交谈）。Mary端着甜品进来。Sherlock发现自己坐直了身，双脚收向了扶手椅，跷起了一条腿。她递给Sherlock相当大的一份香蕉奶油太妃派，把John的和她自己的那份放在茶几上，又蜷回了John的身边。Mary伸手取来她的盘子，切下一大块横举在John的面前。简直可怕。然后，John张开嘴吃掉了它，鼻子上蹭了一点奶油。Mary把奶油抹掉，笑了起来。他们两个都在笑（手，手臂， 腿，后颈，脸颊，膝盖）。Sherlock把盘子搁在桌上，抿下一口威士忌，这一回味道变苦了——也许是因为他舌上太妃的甜味。他又喝下一口。“不打算吃完你的派吗？” Mary问。Sherlock晃晃头才回到了现实。“哦，呃，很美味，但是我恐怕正餐吃的多了些，简直——吃不下了——”话一出口变得稍有些含混不清——一切变得模糊起来。Mary拿起盘子带去厨房，再次留他们单独在一起。他又举起杯子，喝光了杯子里的残余。他站起来，觉得是时候逃离这种郊区的居家氛围了，但他起身时一下没站稳，John伸出手，站起来扶住了他，手臂环在他的腰侧。Sherlock突然渴望回到贝克街——深色的墙纸，光滑的皮革，柔软的床单，丝质睡袍，茶的气味，还有炉火烘暖皮肤的感觉，而当他把头埋在John的肩上他感受到了这一切。他吸入那气息，仿佛他能借此维系生命一般。但是，他不在他该在的地方，没有处于正确的时刻。Clair de la lune的气味在他喉中凝塞。他在这芳香中难以呼吸，几近窒息。John在说话，在对他说着什么（有点太多了，沙发，额外的枕头，在这里过夜），但他的声音还能勉强替他作答（出租车，他没事，晚餐很愉快，谢谢Mary）。在外面，小雨凉凉地打在他的脸上，湿得不舒服，但多少让他清醒了点。他远远看见街上有一家人进了房门，他能听见他们的笑声，屋里还有一只狗在叫。他窝进出租车的后座，给出了他的地址，而当他关上车门，只有渐渐加急的雨盖过了引擎的声音。他保证回到贝克街后给John发短信，于是也确实这么做了，手指在键盘上来回，笨拙得丢人。没有费事脱衣服，他一头栽进沙发，闭紧双眼，沉入寂静，聆听着围绕他的虚无。两年的奔波还是太久了，即便在这里，即便任务已经完成、即便他终于回了家……什么都不对了。一切的一切，都不对了。

原文：https://archiveofourown.org/works/2075502 正文： John追寻着Sherlock回荡在湿暗小巷里的脚步声，Lestrade就跟在他身后。不到半个小时之前，经过将近两天的调查，他们终于追查到凶手在Hackney一家肉店楼上废弃的公寓里。但一切绝对不会那么简单。手握尖刀，凶手立刻向外猛击，几乎碰到了Lestrade的脸。John把Sherlock拉住，凶手趁机跳出窗户，摇摇晃晃地下了防火梯。Sherlock一跃而起追了过去，John和Lestrade只能努力地赶上他。“前体操队队员。”Sherlock在之前的调查中提过，的确没错。就算是Sherlock，也相当勉强才能越过栏杆和车辆紧追其后，鉴于John直到Sherlock在几个月前“死而复生”后，才再次被卷进在小巷里追赶罪犯的事务，他依旧相当疏于练习。然而时至今日，Sherlock依旧比Google更了解伦敦的大街小巷，他设法把凶手逼进了死胡同。John的耳中血液轰鸣，他跟Lestrade的脚步重击在地上。越过这些声响，他听见另外一对脚步声停了下来，随之传来还有挣扎的声音。他得再快一点赶到。他转过街角，正看见Sherlock躲过一击，但在他下蹲时，凶手敏捷地后仰避过了撞击。John看见了有金属一闪而过，连忙冲上前去，但是还是不够快——刀刃在John赶到之前划伤了Sherlock的侧身。John匆匆一踢解除了凶手的武装，狠狠地把他按倒在人行道上，膝盖顶住他的后背，手扣住他的双腕。“Jesus！Sherlock！”John气喘吁吁，肺里尽是灼烧感，等着Lestrade带着手铐赶到。“我没事。”Sherlock咬着牙说。他弯着腰，一手捂着腹部，就在腰部以上。Lestrade终于追了上来，对着电话大喊大叫找着他队里的其他人，把凶手拽起来拖走了。“我必须带Sherlock去A&amp;E。”John对Lestrade说。“如果你需要证词，我们可以明天找个时间过来。”Lestrade点点头，让他们离开。“我不需要去医院。”Sherlock厉声说。“只是划伤而已，我见过更糟的。我回去自己处理。”但他连站直都费力，紧紧地捂着伤处。“让我看看。”John说，为了进一步检查站得近了些。Sherlock不屑地一翻眼睛，但还是服从了，把衬衫下摆从裤子里拉出来向上提起，足以让John看到伤口。开始下起小雨，John不得不把湿度眨出眼睛。创口大概有三英寸，并不是太深，出的血不是特别多，不过——“你需要缝针。”他告诉Sherlock。“我在家就有医疗箱。还有抗生素。我可不想为这点我半个小时就能处理完的小事，在医院等上四个小时。我要回去。”John叹了口气，从自己脖子上拽下围巾，把它贴在Sherlock的伤口上，然后把Sherlock的手移到顶端，无声地示意他按住。有的东西永远不会变。他捏了捏鼻梁。“好吧，就这样吧，不过——可别想着我会让你自己处理。让我来做。”“没这个必要。”Sherlock说，他本想装作毫不在意地挥挥手，却发现手上沾满了血，不得不赶紧把手按回侧身。“也许。可是我才是医生。”就算血没有流得到处都是，John也只有多付些钱，司机才同意载他们回去。在路上他给Mary打了电话，告诉她他会晚些回去。到了贝克街，他不得不扶着Sherlock上台阶进了公寓。刚刚进门，他们脱下大衣，John先指指Sherlock，又指向厨房的方向。“你，到厨房去。坐下。”他打开了灯，问：“医疗箱在哪？”“在卫生间洗手池下面。”Sherlock说，缓慢地、小心地降下身来坐在椅子上。John走开去找医疗箱，路上顺手把灯打开。他很容易就找到了医疗箱，庆幸地发现它跟自己备在家里的专业医疗箱差不多。在厨房里，Sherlock已经脱下了西服外套，把它挂在了椅背上。他的腿在面前神展开，为了尽量挺直身体，他以一个很不舒服的角度斜倾着。John知道Sherlock坐在沙发上会更舒服一些，但他需要厨房的灯光才能看得清楚些。“好了。”John说。他尽快把桌上的物品移到了柜橱台面上，其中包括文件、显微镜、一盒载玻片，显然还有一盒指甲，然后用异丙醇擦了一遍桌子。他把他需要的器械摆开，然后走向水池去洗手。戴上了手套，他说：“好了，让我看看。”Sherlock又把衬衫下摆提起来。John的围巾还被他按在伤口上，当John把它移开时他缩了缩。“血已经差不多止住了。挺不错。”他说。Sherlock发出的低哼更像是咕哝。“你的衬衫。”John说，他需要更方便地接触伤处。奇怪的是，Sherlock在犹豫。John扬起了眉毛。Sherlock以前可一点都没有腼腆过，这也不是他第一回在结案之后需要John替他包扎伤口了。Sherlock咽着口水，John发现他整个身体变得甚至比之前更僵了。“又没什么我之前没见过的。”他说，对Sherlock这样奇怪的原因毫无头绪。Sherlock叹了口气，仿佛那让他很痛，但他的手指移向了纽扣，从袖口开始。他挪向了衣襟，慢慢地、一顿一顿地解开扣子，但最终他把衬衫抖下肩头，扔向了冰箱的方向。衬衫落成了褶皱染血的一堆。John清清嗓子。该干活了。他贴近他的侧身去检查伤口的状况，然后开始清洁伤口，手指动作尽可能轻柔，每一次在Sherlock抽痛吸气的时候都收回手来。他没有说抱歉——有些事是一定会疼的。缝针与包扎没有费多少时间。没过一会他就回到了水池前，扔掉了手套，再次洗起手来。“你没事吧？”他问，转过身去。“没事。”Sherlock说，他站了起来，转身面向通往走廊的门——去他的卧室。而那时John才看见。他觉得空气从他的肺中被抽空了。“停。”“我说了我没事，John。”Sherlock说，但他的头低了下来，一手扶在门框上支撑着自己。这让John看的甚至更清楚了——看清了让Sherlock如此紧张的一切。那是疤痕，数十道疤痕，勾结在Sherlock苍白的后背上。John见过Sherlock赤裸的肌肤——比任何一个室友应该见过的都要多——在他以前和Sherlock一起住在这里的时候，Sherlock经常会裹着床单、毛巾，只穿着睡裤或内裤，甚至什么都不穿地走来走去。John见过跳进翻斗车后满身汗水与灰尘的Sherlock，见过洗完澡后湿透的Sherlock，见过几天没有洗上澡的Sherlock，但他从来没有——自从他离开阿富汗之后就没有——见过这样的疤痕。他的脚在他意识到之前就挪动了，走向Sherlock所在的地方，然后他伸出了手，贴在Sherlock的脊柱上。Sherlock的肌肉在他的触摸下紧张地颤动，John不禁伸出了另一只手，稳在他的身侧。“什么？”他说，但那微弱得不过像一声呼气，甚至算不上低语。“John，”Sherlock说，听上去似乎本该像是警告，但他语气里只有疲惫，悲哀得近乎绝望。“请别这样，我不想……”他清清嗓子，声音里缀满了情感，远远比John通常习惯的要多。John没有让他继续他的想法。John必须要知道。他的手指在Sherlock左肩胛上一道早已愈合的伤疤上轻抚着。Sherlock没有抽身离开。“这都是什么，Sherlock？”他说，而现在他听见了自己窒住的声音。Sherlock又叹了口气。他慢慢地摇着头。“你不是……我从来不想……”随着John的指尖触及更多的伤疤，他的声音渐渐弱了下去。这些的位置更低一些，靠近他的脊椎——一连串的烧伤（烟头？），一共五个，像巨大的蚂蚁排成一列。当他的手指拂过这些疤痕，他的拇指贴了上去。Sherlock的皮肤很温暖，比John缝针的时候更暖，但也许那是因为他摘下了手套。他另一侧的肩膀上还有一个凸起的伤疤，环在顶部，如同是锁链中的一环。“Sherlock，”John说，喉咙里似乎充满了硬结，他试着吞咽，但那没用。他咳了咳。“这是什么？”他重复着。Sherlock转过身来，立在他面前。双眼灼烧，John抬头看着他，期望着挑衅，期望着任何东西，却意想不到地看见了他完全不熟悉的眼神，挫败而破碎。Sherlock一言不发地绕过他，把厨房里的椅子转到一侧，斜坐在上面，把后背露向整个房间。一个邀请。John清清嗓子，跟了过去，拖来另一张椅子，坐得很近，他要张开两膝才能被容进面前Sherlock的身体所在的空间。Sherlock深吸一口气，略略一滞，伸展着身体来适应他新添的缝线。大约一分钟，只有沉默，安静的呼吸，以及不需要触摸就足以分享热度的贴近，但最终Sherlock开了口。“那不是个游戏。”他说。“什么？”John没有明白。“我不想要谜语，Sherlock，我想让你告诉我。”“我是在告诉你，”他说，现在听上去有点恼怒，更贴近正常了。这是个小小的安慰。“你说我是‘去玩捉迷藏’，但我不是。”他又陷入了沉默。John的手指抽动了一下，他想要触摸。他轻碰着Sherlock左肋后一个近乎完整的、三英寸的圆形疤痕（钻头？）。这一个凸起发红，疤痕的顶部光亮而平滑。John的手指勾画着它的线条，然后缩回一点，最终贴进了圆的中间，里面只有肌肤。“那么，是什么？”John问，他尝试着稳住声音，出口的却像是恳求。Sherlock吸了口气。“你问过我为什么——在第一个晚上。”又一次停顿，John没有急，等着Sherlock继续。他确实又开口了。“但是，Mary在那里，所以我决定——”“决定怎样，Sherlock？”（What，Sherlock？）“你还是不知道的好。本来就很困难了。我已经给你带来了足够的痛苦，完全搞砸了一切。你很幸福——在那个时候不是因为我，当然，不过——的确。而我——我毁了……”“什么，Sherlock？”John又说着。（What，Sherlock？）“我回来得太晚了，我不够快，不够聪明。”他的呼吸一窒。John继续抚摸着，那些银色的、红色的、深色的，像胎记一样然而却不是胎记的线条。“两年，”Sherlock说。“我被抓住过——有两次是故意的——那些施虐狂们在以为自己占了上风的时候更容易透露信息。而有一次——不是故意的。如果没有Mycroft——也许就——”他摇了摇头。John的双手几乎停在了他的腰上，抚摸着那里的皮肤，意识到自己现在只是为了触摸而触摸，但没有把手收回来。“那么，为什么？”John问。“你说那不是个游戏。”“不是。”Sherlock说。John听见他吞咽的声音。“那是——是为了你。”寂静又一次降临，虽然John真的、真的想要进一步的解释——就他妈的现在——他还是等着。“Moriarty必须被阻止。但即使他炸翻了整个世界，一切也不可能那么可怕……他让人跟踪你——狙击手。还有Mrs Hudson和Lestrade。”“这个你告诉过我。Mycroft处理了一切。”“不，”Sherlock说。“直到他的整个网络被摧毁——你必须认为……我不得不保持死去的假象，你不明白吗？而我——我宁可你活着，活着，继续你的生活。我从没想过要回来。你应该得到幸福，应该活着，而我——我本该死去。”John缓缓地、长长地呼气，头落在Sherlock的背上。他的前额轻轻地蹭着他的背，完全不知道该说什么。他的手上移，拂过肌肉和凸起的皮肤，被毁掉的血肉，骨与筋腱，一百万种不同的质感。Sherlock的左手找到了他的，盖在他的左手上，带着它慢慢地挪到Sherlock的胸口，覆住他的心脏。温暖的皮肤，柔软的毛发，他手指下是强壮的搏动。“他一直想烧毁我的心。”Sherlock说。与其说是听见，不如说John是感觉到了随后他轻轻的苦笑。“他做到了。”John动了动，鼻子擦过Sherlock的后背，嘴唇吻着一条疤痕，全身由内在而颤抖。“我还在这儿，Sherlock。”在客厅里，John手机的短信提示音响了。他们都知道短信是谁发的。“不。”Sherlock说，他站起来，缩了回去，然后越走越远。“你不在了。”

原文：https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149182 正文： The will to neither strive nor cry, The power to feel with others give! Calm, calm me more! nor let me die Before I have begun to live. ——Matthew Arnold 不再奋求或哭泣的意志， 源于感同身受的力量！ 再度使我平静！也不要让我死去 在我开始生活之前。 （粗译，一定有很多不恰当的地方，欢迎指正） 这是一个关于Sherlock怎样活得久到可以变老的故事。 在很久以前，Sherlock就确信他注定早逝。这是唯一一个合理的结论，真的。 起码那些少数能让他稍稍快乐一点的感觉——换句话说，就是药物、危险和追逐带来的肾上腺素——就对维持正常的寿命很不利了；他讨厌其他的人，更不屑于年长之后普通人之间相互支撑的关系；而更糟糕的，最糟糕的，是他感到多么无聊，是他变得多么难以置信地厌倦生活，是他面对每天仅仅生存的平淡有多么挫败。他需要致命的兴奋，需要亲身涉险的刺激。若想活着，他只有走向悬在死亡之上的钢丝，在生死边缘勉强维持平衡，凝视他脚下的虚无。面对这样一个人，又谈何未来？ 一个面对生存只知道一次又一次放任自己沉浸于这样感受的人，又怎么可能开始思考他生命逐渐逼近的终结呢？既然很清楚自己是个什么样的人，Sherlock度过了一天又一天，从未考虑过未来，只对他那不可避免的确切死因感到轻微的好奇。 24岁的时候，Sherlock不小心用药过量，在26岁的时候故意“不小心”用药过量。他对他哥哥每一次把他拉出深渊的尝试冷笑，逃出了Mycroft为他找的每一个昂贵的康复中心。 28岁时，Mycroft跟他说他已经无可救药了。“这是你选择的人生，Sherlock，而我不会在这对着一个死人白费唇舌。”Sherlock毫不惊讶，他其实大体上同意Mycroft的判断。在29岁时，Greg Lestrade因为他持有违禁物品逮捕了他，而当Sherlock在恶臭不堪的拘留室里憔悴地抛出一长串推理，等待着一个不会再现身的Mycroft的时候，Lestrade警士成了苏格兰场常驻人员中第一个注意到的人。Sherlock给他提供了解开一桩棘手三重谋杀案的关键，作为回报，Lestrade设法让持有违禁物的指控消失了。 Lestrade让他注意到他破案的天赋可以代替药物滥用的快感，因而Sherlock相应地调高了他的预期寿命。在全面的评估之后，Sherlock决定，35岁就是他立下的分界线。他活不过35岁。他是那样的人，他过的就是那样的生活。34岁，在他与遗忘命定的约会前一年，Sherlock遇到了一个人。没什么特别的，或者他是这样以为的，一个平淡无奇的人——实际上却是不可思议的，一个为了挽救Sherlock自己完全不在乎的性命，可以毫不犹豫动手杀人的人。当时，在别人长着一颗心的地方，某些东西在Sherlock胸中扎下了根。当然，它生长得很慢，慢到他甚至没有意识到发生了什么，直到他站在屋顶边缘、头发被冷风拂乱，跟他唯一的朋友道别的那一刻。即使他不需要真的死去（这只是个戏法，John，只是个小伎俩），他觉得如果实在要迈出那一步也并不困难，因为这已经无关紧要，他35岁了，已经到了时候，如果他真的是不得不结束生命，他也准备好了，这没什么，一切尽在意料之中。但当他对John说再见的时候，他居然流下了眼泪，并且在他跳下去的一刻意识到了一件着实令他震惊的事： 我不想死。 这个想法让他挺过了孤独而漫长的两年。 38岁时，他为John Watson毫不眨眼地杀了一个人。他的哥哥说他已经毁了自己的人生，可Sherlock知道并非如此。如果他本来就活不长，至少他已经找到了值得为之付出他这短暂一生的人。他真的觉得自己问心无愧了。毕竟是三条命换一条命，就死亡这样一件可悲的琐事而言，已经是一桩相当不错的交易了。就在Sherlock镇静地向自己的命运缴械投降时，飞机掉头落回大不列颠的土地，他最后才辨认出溢满他胸腔的陌生而疯狂的感受。那竟是宽慰。 伪装Moriarty的人得到了处理，Moran的网络也被根除。Sherlock现在明白了，关切，一旦被适当的聚焦，能够以致命的精准进行毁灭。他不懂得怎么生存，但他有了值得为之死去的东西，于是他无怨无悔、毫不留情地践行了这一理解。 Violet Eugenia Watson在一个星期四的雨夜降生。“坐下。”John说道。Sherlock照做了，脱下他的Belstaff，窝进医院丑陋的塑料扶手椅。John轻柔地把襁褓中的婴儿递到他怀里。“John，”Sherlock惊异地轻声说着，“你创造了一个小小的人类。”“唔，主要的活儿都是Mary的，说实话。”John微笑着，“我只不过贡献了点儿原料。”Sherlock没有回答，入神地盯着他最好朋友的女儿。他轻轻地把毯子揭起来一点，观察着她纤巧的手指和脚趾。 世界是这么大，如此之大，你却这么小。 他闭上被泪水滚热地刺痛的双眼。“她很完美。”他说。“是啊。”John回答。 终于，在一个星期六，一个温暖的下午，Mary的过去毁了她。她和John当时在Asda（注：英国超市）的停车场，把买到的杂物装进后备箱，十三个月大的Violet还坐在购物车里。接到Lestrade的短信时，Sherlock正在进行一个复杂的化学实验。他碰巧在进行最关键的操作，于是忽视了第一条和第二条短信。他记得是这样。哪怕最终一切都是无济于事，在那之后，他还是想了很多。 Sherlock钻过警戒线，忽视了叫嚣的警察，疾步走向坐在人行道上目光空洞的John，Mary的血染污了他的毛衣。Violet被毯子裹着，在他怀里啜泣不休。有那么一刻，Sherlock忽视了躺在汽车旁边的尸体——她死了，已经没有什么他能做的了——而跪在John身边，抽下他的手套去触碰他的脸，检测他的脉搏，搜寻伤处。他需要安下心来，即使Lestrade一遍又一遍地告诉他只有Mary受到了袭击。“我没事，Sherlock，”John的声音因为震惊变得机械而麻木。“我们没事。”Sherlock的手指轻抚着孩子柔软的金发。她哭得更凶了，躲开他的触摸，缩在自己父亲的脖子周围。John反射一般轻拍着她，安慰着她，而Sherlock突然感受到一种可怕的、压倒一切的无助。“Sherlock，”Lestrade的声音从他背后传来。“Sherlock，我们需要你。”“去吧，”John说，“去吧。去帮他们。”Sherlock点点头，起身转了过去。他已经知道了自己会找到什么，但他还是向Mary的尸体走了过去，手指和大脑仿佛按照固定程式一样运行着。只有一枪，远距离射击，在双眼中间。一枪毙命，不可能生还。凶手是从超市屋顶开的枪。Mary是唯一的目标。没有个人恩怨，只是例行公事。Mary的眼睛还是睁开的。她穿着一件棉质磨毛面的深绿色外套，那种所有城郊的母亲都穿的衣服，右边的衣袖蹭着半干的唾液和黏液。 她曾用她的袖子擦拭她孩子的脸。那是她做的最后一件事，对着她呲着小牙、流着口水的宝贝微笑，温柔而满怀爱意地擦着她小小的下巴。在生命的最后一刻她看见的是她女儿的脸。 他闭上眼，用鼻子缓缓地呼吸，几乎被晕眩压倒。Sherlock感受到Mycroft的靠近，于是站起来，转身，背向人行道上的尸体。他没法再注视Mary。他做不到。“没有什么推理的必要了，弟弟。”Mycroft的声音已经没有了惯常的油滑。Sherlock很清楚Mycroft的意思。别折磨自己了，Sherlock，一切都是徒劳。“确实，而且无论如何真实的细节都不会被人得知，我想。”Sherlock赞同着。“你知道这一直是很可能的结果，Sherlock。”Mycroft哀伤地喃喃道。Sherlock知道。他什么都没有说。兄弟二人静默地站在那里。Sherlock为这个世界依旧存在着而略微感到惊讶，他听见Violet哭着找她的母亲。“我该做什么，Mycroft？”Sherlock绝望地轻声问着。“告诉我。”“你唯一能做的。”Mycroft回答。“带他们回家。”Lestrade站在几尺之外，足以听到他们的对话而不进行打扰。Sherlock的目光转向他，他立刻点了头。一辆黑车停在警戒线之外。Sherlock走到John身旁，触碰他的肩膀。“来吧，John，该走了。”John连动都没动一下。“John，”Sherlock说，多了一点强制的意味。“天要黑了，Violet会冷的。我们带她去个暖和的地方。”这时John才回应，费力地挣扎着站起来，把女儿紧紧抱在胸前。Sherlock的手轻按在John的背上，引他向等着他们的车走去。John茫然地跟着Sherlock的引领，心思完全不在这里。Sherlock简短地考虑了一下车座的问题，随后意识到John或许根本无法放开自己的孩子。汽车开动，Violet的啜泣在精疲力竭之中消弱，然后她睡着了。Sherlock看着她呼吸，她的小面孔涨红着，长长的睫毛上依旧挂着泪珠。John一言不发，石头一般淡漠沉寂。纸尿片、奶瓶和换洗衣物已经被送到了221B的前廊里。 据讣告，Mary Watson在一个超市的停车场因为突发的、灾难性的脑动脉瘤破裂去世。Sherlock给John系好领带，打理了他的头发，Mrs Hudson抱着Violet。在葬礼上，John如一尊雕像般木然，没有一滴眼泪。Violet在他脚边玩耍，丝毫意识不到发生了什么。仪式是私人的，规模很小。毕竟，不会有太多的人来为一个未曾真正存在过的女人哀悼。 John不吃不睡，唯有在他给Violet换衣服、洗澡或者抱着她时他才展现出一点生气，可其余的时候他对一切漠不关心，让Sherlock不想把他们单独留在公寓里。Violet和John一起睡在楼上John的旧双人床上。Mycroft送来一张小床，但它空置在房间的角落里。不得不担下照顾他人的陌生职责，Sherlock感到茫然无措。他泡了茶，可茶在John纹丝不动的手边冷掉了。他试着烤吐司，可他太容易分心，面包最后都成了焦炭。当Violet变得喜怒不定、难于安抚的时候，Sherlock试着抱她，可他总是紧张而焦虑，Violet会在他怀里挣扎哭泣。不过，Mrs Hudson抱着她时她会安定下来，让Sherlock觉得自己被她评估之后被打上了“资格尚缺”的标签。看上去，他唯一能做的有些用的事，就是连续几小时拉着小提琴，直到他的手指痉挛灼痛，直到两个Watson在John的扶手椅里入睡，彼此带着泪蜷在一起。在Mrs Hudson能够跟他们待在一起的时候，Sherlock在摄政公园里漫步，尝试着理清他杂乱的思绪，为他秘密渴望John回到身边的每一刻感到悔恨。我不是故意的，他想着，觉得自己像个和一位遥远而冷酷的神灵讨价还价的小孩。我收回一切，我不是真的想要这样。求你。不是这样。十年来的第一次，他毫不犹豫的给自己的母亲打了电话。“我要怎么解决？”他问她。“这样的事没法‘解决’，亲爱的，”她难过地说。“耐心点，随着时间过去，一切都会没事的。”所以，既然无力给他们其他的东西，Sherlock会给他们时间。他关掉手机，把访客拒之门外，来给他们时间。 葬礼过去六天之后，John为Violet做了炒蛋和吐司。八天之后，他整理了客厅，把她的玩具收在洗衣篮里。十天之后，他开始读报。十二天之后，他拿起了一支铅笔试着做卫报的填字游戏。他卡在了第三行，Sherlock一不小心没管好自己的嘴说他是白痴。看着Sherlock惊恐的表情，John实际上露出了微笑，比起他真正的微笑只是个苍白的影子，但依旧确确实实地在那里。“没关系的，Sherlock。回归正常了。这很好。”一切在好转。尽管一步步走得迟缓而痛苦，一切都在好转。 十六天之后，Sherlock从泥土样本中抬起头来，发现John徘徊在厨房门口，看上去迟疑不决。“别再四处转悠，来告诉我你在想什么。”Sherlock起身灌满了水壶，与其说想要泡茶，不如说他想是给John一点空间来说出他要说的东西。John坐在了厨房的椅子上。“我需要考虑回去工作。”他说。“我同意。”Sherlock想起了他在网上查的东西。“重新进行日常活动对于从精神创伤中恢复极有帮助。”“是啊，我猜也是。还有，总要付账。不管怎样，我得在房子附近找一家幼儿园，重新规划一下每天要做的，并且……我们一定呆得久到超出被欢迎的范围了。我只是想让你知道你很了不起，我们也不会继续打扰很久了。”Sherlock知道这总要发生，但他还是觉得自己像瞬间被掏空了一般。“你们要回到自己的房子去了？”“嗯，没错。再过个一两天。我知道没有小孩子烦你你会松一大口气的。”Sherlock细细地洗出了两个马克杯。“Violet一点也没烦到我。”John哼了一声。“这我可一点也不信。”“真的，就小孩子来讲，她相当地易于容忍。”因为她是你的一部分，Sherlock在心里默默地添上，用一条相对干净的毛巾一角擦干了杯子。“在Putney，你没有人帮忙。你的父母住的太远，你们的关系也不是特别好，Harry不够可靠，你又不喜欢你的邻居。确切点说，他们也不喜欢你。”John无声地、毫不幽默地笑了。“那倒没错。不过我们会解决这个的。我们会没事的。”他的眼睛紧盯着桌面，双肩紧绷。他觉得我不想要他们在这。Sherlock被悲伤刺痛了。还是这样，在一切之后。自己跳下St Bart's的屋顶竟然这样可怕地动摇了John对他的信任，千次万次，Sherlock感到尖刻的痛悔。Sherlock叹了口气，多半是对自己感到恼怒，设法把反射性的那句别像个白痴一样堵在了嘴里。他在餐桌旁坐下。“John，当然你可以自由地做出最好的选择，但是你要明白……这里会一直是你和Violet的家。”Sherlock吞下喉咙里不存在的硬结，又不太必要地加了一句：“在我这里。”他迫切地想让John抬头看看他。看着我，John，从我的脸上读出那些我说不出口的东西。John确实抬头了，哀伤的深蓝色眼睛迎上了Sherlock的目光。“而且，”Sherlock添上，“Mrs Hudson该会有多担心。”John听了，露出一丝微笑。“那就向我保证，别再一个劲泡茶了。”John说，“那可把我吓坏了。”“好。”那天晚上，在Violet睡下之后，改成John来泡茶，带给Sherlock一杯。“你在读什么？”他问，向Sherlock手中的杂志瞥了一眼，一只温暖的手在Sherlock的肩上。“一篇关于North Carolina的Ocracoke的文章，一个小岛，在海岸线外。据传说，黑胡子把他的宝藏藏在那里，但是没人找到过。”“我们应该去试试。”John说。“我打赌你在我们下车之前就能找到宝藏。”“你对我预期过高了，John，就像以往一样。”“我相当确定我没有。”John说。他吻了Sherlock的头顶，仅是嘴唇的轻轻一擦。“我要去睡了，那么，晚安。”Sherlock没有回答，很长时间纹丝不动，在他的记忆宫殿里为John的嘴唇轻擦他头发的回忆筑起了一个高耸的水晶底座。John回去工作了，Violet开始去幼儿园。Mycroft表示想给他们找一个全职的家居保姆；Sherlock带着夸张的惊恐盯着他的手机，然后把它扔在了沙发靠垫的后面。Sherlock开始接案子；没有什么危险，只是活动大脑而已，没有横跨伦敦的追逐，没有连环杀手，没有成天比划刀子的疯子。他知道他很快就会思念那种刺激，但目前一切还好。Violet和Sherlock稍微友善了些，在John洗澡、把衣服放进烘干机或者休息的时候暂且同意跟Sherlock共处一室。虽说她还是不喜欢Sherlock抱她，只能在恐慌中保持一分钟的静止，接着大哭大叫，一通乱捶，闹着要找爸爸。“这需要时间，亲爱的。”Mrs Hudson说。Violet抱着她的脖子，眼泪汪汪地吸着鼻子，控诉一样盯着Sherlock，仿佛他是全人类的悲惨之源。“她这个年龄很怕生，而且她刚刚失去她的母亲。”“她不喜欢我。”Sherlock抱怨道。“她是个小孩，Sherlock，你不是。”Mrs Hudson稍稍有些暴躁地说，一边把Violet抱到楼下，以免把在沙发上小睡的John吵醒。“一切并不总是以你为中心的，你知道。” Sherlock生了会儿闷气，然后开始思考他遇见John以前的生活，那时一切都是以他为中心的，那时他还享有自私的奢侈特权。他记得那有多么单调、空虚和绝望，他记得他只有麻木地等待死亡来结束他的无聊。Sherlock试着回想起他上一次感到无聊的时候，却想不起来了。那么这就成了一笔交易吗？他想。我不会再无聊，但我再也不能做个自私的混蛋了？从衡量得失的角度来看，如果不痛快成交那他简直就是傻瓜。他走下楼，找到了坐在餐桌旁的Mrs Hudson。流着鼻涕的Violet坐在她的大腿上，漫不经心地啃着什么。Sherlock坐下了。“对不起，亲爱的。”她拍拍他的手。“我没想用那样的语气说话。小孩有时候很难对付。”“我决定，”他说，“以后不再自私了。”Mrs Hudson对他微笑着，和蔼的眼睛里带着一丝忧伤。“Sherlock，”她说。“哦，亲爱的，你很久以前就不再自私了，你只是没意识到而已。” 在上了幼儿园之后两周，Violet生病了，小脸苍白，发起烧来，不断地打喷嚏。Sherlock坐立不安，John则更坦然一点。“这种事一直会有。一接触一群新的孩子，就会有新的病菌。”“可她这么烫。”Sherlock说。他把Violet（她在尖叫）抱在腿上让John给她检查，都能感受到她散发出的热量。“发烧是好的，是生病过程的一部分。”John说。“可她很难受。”Sherlock指责着。医生应该解决这种东西，而不是高高兴兴地接收一个小孩的痛苦。“是啊。”他说，从医生变回了父亲。“我知道。”他把她从Sherlock怀里接过来。“你很难受，是不是？可怜的、生病的宝贝儿。”他把她抱在脖子周围。“这只是感冒，Sherlock。一种病毒罢了。”John伸出手，轻轻地握住Sherlock的前臂。“她只需要多喝水，好好睡觉，两三天就会好。我保证。”Sherlock盯着John安抚着他的手指。“你想让我去一趟Tesco吗？”他不知不觉问出了口。John惊讶地扬起了眉毛。“你知道Tesco在哪吗？”“说真的，John，我是享誉世界的咨询侦探。我确定我能查出来它在哪儿。”“我该给你开个清单。”“这样应该最好。”Sherlock回来的时候带了两磅生鸡肝和三种酸辣酱，但同样设法买到了苹果汁、纸巾和一条面包。John对他温和地笑着，让Sherlock觉得整个人都暖和起来了。虽说Violet一般都像只流着口水的小老虎一样抵抗着睡眠，Sherlock一拿起琴弓开始演奏几分钟，她的眼皮就开始打架了。在第一乐章结束之前她就睡熟了，四肢放松，小嘴张着。“我带她上楼。”John说，“马上就回来。”Sherlock点点头，继续演奏着。大约一刻钟之后John从楼上下来、钻进了厨房，带着两杯茶出来。他把Sherlock那杯放在小圆桌上，拿着自己的坐下，闭上双眼，在地毯上伸开双腿。最后一个音符在Sherlock放下小提琴时飘散，John动了一小下，伸展开身体，然后笑了。“她到了中间阶段，烧得滚烫。”John在Sherlock把小提琴收进琴箱时说着。“我不知道这样在她旁边我还怎么能睡着。”Sherlock感觉到了这一刻的降临，以他偶然会有的那种诡异的确信意识到，他们两个突然出人意料地走到了一个十字路口。或许还是没那么出人意料，他想，记起John停在他头发上温暖的嘴唇。Sherlock小心翼翼地扣紧了琴箱，做出了决定。他已经学会了怎样不（那么）自私。现在，摆在他面前的任务是学会怎么（更）坦诚地面对他爱的人。“那就跟我一起睡吧。”Sherlock说，声音因为他自己的话变得不稳。John没有笑，没有抗议，也没有婉拒。事实上，在仿佛永恒的一刻里，他什么都没做，双眼紧闭，手指裹着马克杯的把手。“好吧。”他最后深呼一口气。“好，可以。”Sherlock的手指无力地把杯子从John的手里拿出来，把它放在扶手椅边的小桌上。他对John伸出了手。John看了一会，然后带着笑影握住了Sherlock的手。“拿上婴儿监护器。”他说。Sherlock握着John的手，把他引入阴暗的卧室，途中停下拿上了婴儿监控器。他关上了他们身后的门，小心地把白色的小音箱放在床头柜上，胃仿佛自己打成了结一样。他站直，犹疑地看着John。在外面街灯昏暗的光线下，John平静地注视着他，脸上是读不透的表情。他挪得近了些，手伸进丝质的晨袍，轻放在Sherlock的髋骨上。“那么，”John说。“这就是我们要做的事情。”“除非你不想。”Sherlock绝望地想要John留下，可他想确认John也心甘情愿。“这取决于你，完全取决于你。”“一直以来都是这样，对不对？”John说。“取决于我。”Sherlock点头，不敢说话。“那么好吧。”John说，然后吻了他。 不像是烟火，不像是爆炸；那是一种温暖幽暗的快感，缓缓从Sherlock的肋骨之下攀升，向外延展，带着厚滞慵懒的热度填满他的四肢、大脑和下体。John向他张开了嘴唇，他们的舌头相遇，这不可思议的感觉让John发出一小声呜咽，John的声音又将一阵刺痒送下他的脊椎。John的味道独占了他的味觉与嗅觉，让他晕眩，让他的膝盖难以支撑自己。Sherlock沉到床上，拉着John跟他一起。John的双腿跨在他身上，双手与他的头发交缠，双唇落在他的脖颈之上，让Sherlock喘息不止。Sherlock的臀部与John的相碰，他能感到彼此相抵的硬度，几乎认不出自己因此发出的小小幽咽属于自己。在长如几小时的几分钟，或短似几分钟的几小时内，他们一直这样，像青春期的少年一样亲吻着，触摸着，互相摩擦，甚至没有脱去一件衣服，直到John抽身断开了他们的吻，重重地喘息着。“Sherlock，”他说，温暖的手按在Sherlock的胸口。“我们得……我们能慢下来一点吗？”你现在是陷入了你可厌的性取向危机了吗？Sherlock在心里冷笑一声，但是挡下了尚未出口的话语。John现在处在一个很艰难的境地，他并不想……“不，停下。”John说，温柔地抚着Sherlock的脸。“别像对待易碎品那样对我。你最近有点过于体贴了，我很感激，但那不是你，你不用再那样了。直接说吧。”“好吧。”Sherlock说着，声音远比他内心更镇静。“你在为你的取向恐慌，你担心你犯了个错误，会毁掉我们的友谊，而如果你想改主意我……”“Sherlock，不。”John轻吻着他，温软湿柔。“不是这样的，我想要这个。我想要你。我只是需要……”他深吸一口气。“我的生活现在天翻地覆、一片混乱，我有个孩子，我并不想搞砸一切而且我对自己在做什么毫无头绪。但是这绝不是因为你是个男人，好吗？我想要你，而我对你的性别一点也不在乎。有点让人吃惊，我猜，但是是真的。”Sherlock放松了一点。“好吧，这可以理解。”“好。”John退到Sherlock身侧，蜷在他身边，头枕在他的胸膛上。“我们有的是时间，先别头脑发热冲动行事。”Sherlock抚着John柔软的头发。“我大概是时候告诉你些什么了。”“什么都行。”“我从来没有……我是说我做过。可是。并不是很多。而且很久，很久都没有过了。”John轻轻地笑了。“那么我们都是新手了。”“是的。”Sherlock吻着John的头顶。他们静静地躺了一会，彼此交缠，呼吸着对方的气息。John动了动，双臂环住了Sherlock的腰，他绷紧，深呼吸，鼓足了开口的勇气。Sherlock什么也没说，拇指在John的后背磨着小小的圈。“到最后，我开始恨她。”Sherlock收紧了抱住John的双臂，但是依旧一言不发，给John他需要的思考空间。“我爱过她，可是……我觉得自己像个人质。我再也没法信任他，在我知道她的身份之后就没有，但我没法离开。我知道如果出了差错，如果我试着逃开，她会消失，而我会永远失去自己的女儿。”“不会的。”Sherlock低低地咆哮。“我会找到她的，John。我宁可赤手空拳拆毁世界也会找到她。”John的双唇感激地轻蹭他的锁骨。“我知道，Sherlock，我知道你会尽一切努力，可她几乎跟你一样聪明，至少差不多，专业受训只为消失。我们不可能会找到她，而我不能失去我的女儿。我进退两难。”John的呼吸声变得艰难错乱，稍稍有那么一点，而Sherlock知道他是在哭。“当我意识到发生了什么的时候，意识到她死了，你知道我什么感觉吗？我如释重负，Sherlock。她不能再从我这里夺走Violet，我自由了，我如释重负。我孩子的母亲就在她面前被谋杀了，而我也曾爱过Mary，可愿上帝原谅我，我如释重负。”Sherlock保持沉默，让John哭泣。John的整个身体都在安静的啜泣中颤抖，Sherlock抚摸着他的后背，爱抚着他的头发，害怕说话，知道无论他说什么都无济于事。眼泪浸湿了Sherlock的T恤，在他的皮肤上留下一片冰凉的潮湿。他只有紧拥着John，等待风暴平息。过了一小会，一切确实平息了，John颤抖着，精疲力竭，无力地靠近Sherlock的肩膀。Sherlock吻着John的前额。“我马上就回来。”他低语着，走到厨房接了一杯水，拿上了一盒纸巾然后回到了他的卧室。John带着鼻音嘟哝着谢谢，擤了擤鼻子，一口气把整杯水都喝掉了。Sherlock脱下他浸湿的T恤，重新回到了床上。“我知道我跟你说了不用这么体贴。”John的声音有些沙哑。“可是，你知道，体贴一点也不错。有点奇怪，可我变习惯了。”“我打算试试。”Sherlock严肃地说。“我也许不会经常成功，但我会试试。”“谢谢。”John轻声说，把Sherlock拉近，开始吻他。本来仅是个简短的、表示感谢的吻，很快变得热火朝天，Sherlock很清楚这是情感波动之后的应激反应，但是他也能感觉得到，那种宽慰，那种冲溅在血管里的肾上腺素带来的令人晕眩的情欲，就像从前夜复一夜他对John到了疼痛程度的渴望。他以贪婪、潮湿、吞噬一切的吻攫取了John的嘴唇，随John在他赤裸肌肤上游走的手指而呻吟，弓起他的身体。John的手滑进他睡裤的裤腰，Sherlock猛喘一口气。“John……你说……你确定吗？”“我确定。天啊，我想碰你。我要你碰我。我确定。求你。”他们在肢体狂热的交织里剥去了彼此的衣物，他们的手触碰着、紧抓着、游移着，脱下的衣服被漫不经心地丢弃在一边。Sherlock的手指在John硬挺的阴茎四围收紧，开始抚弄，一次，两次，让John气喘吁吁。Sherlock的手攻陷着他，愉悦溢满了他的脸，他在Sherlock带给他的快感之中扬起了头。Sherlock探头向前去品尝John暴露在外的脖颈，舔舐细咬，一路向下到了John的躯干，在John的气喘呻吟里深味着他皮肤上滚热的咸度。Sherlock移开了他的手——John为消失的接触发出了呜咽——然后张嘴吞下了他的阴茎，毫不熟练然而热情满腔，为那滚烫的丝绸一般的硬度沉醉。他把John整个吞下，舌头在底部滑动着，换来了一声沙哑的呻吟和缠在他发间的手作为褒奖。“Yes，Sherlock，天啊。我没法相信……哦上帝啊。”John喘着，而Sherlock继续上下挪动，学着更多，累积数据，归类整理着John令人惊艳的反应。Sherlock头发里的手收紧了，紧了一点点。“现在先停。”John喘息着说，于是Sherlock的嘴从John的阴茎上滑下，重新回到上面狠狠地吻他，舌头与牙齿互相冲撞，分享着他唇间John的味道。John调整了自己的位置，让他们紧挨着躺下，髋部紧贴。John的阴茎依旧因唾液而润湿，Sherlock为他们的坚挺相互接触的触感猛抽一口气。“啊，就是这样，love。上帝，这简直完美。你感觉好吗？”“是的。”Sherlock几乎喘不过气。“是的，太不可思议了，别停。”John在他们的身体之间伸手向下，温暖粗糙的手掌裹住他们两个，有力地抚弄着。Sherlock感受到快感如火花一般在他的脊椎之下闪动，使他缩紧，他在快意的猛攻之下闭上双眼，摒弃了一切的羞赧与自知，忘记了和别人分享这一切的可怕的私密，和John一起，哦上帝——“Sherlock，”John不稳地耳语着，吻着Sherlock的脖颈，火热的舌头划过他突出的锁骨。“上帝啊，Sherlock，你要知道，你是我最先爱上的，你一直是——”“我知道。”Sherlock粗哑地说。“我知道。”John把脸埋在Sherlock的肩上，他的手开始加速，他的抚摸随着高潮的逼近变得紊乱。“一直是。”John说。“我一直——”John射了，后背弓起，呻吟困在了喉咙里。温热的潮湿喷溅在Sherlock的腹部。这是John，他想着，射在我身上，在我的怀里——这样的意识送他到了顶峰，他的高潮爆发了，冲上他的脊柱，快感在他的脑中爆炸。Sherlock隐约听见自己发出了非人的声音，他的精液洒在他们两个身上，一切都在颤动，如此辉煌，如此完美——他慢慢平复下来，奋力呼吸着，催产素（注6）冲刷着他，让他变得迟钝困倦，心中填满了温情。他睁开一只眼睛，发现John在看着他，目光里的暖意融化了他的心。“我们早就该这么做了。”John说。“我从前在害怕，我很抱歉。”“错在我们两个。”Sherlock喃喃地说，知道这是真的。“过去无法改变，所以没有必要再想这个了。最重要的是，我们还是走到这一步了。”John将一绺汗湿的卷发从Sherlock眼前拨开。“的确，对不对？”他语气里带着难以置信的成分，吻了吻Sherlock的额头。他们的呼吸平静下来，两个人都渐渐沉入昏倦，即便身上还有精液的黏度。“Hmm。”Sherlock说，打破了沉默。“怎么？”John问。“那真的太不可思议了。”Sherlock说。“难以置信的棒，考虑到你完全是个新手。”John微微扭动，把脸藏在了Sherlock的颈窝里。“我或许上网查了点儿什么。”他对着他的肩膀含糊地说。Sherlock大笑，当短暂的羞怯过去了，John也和他一起笑，那是很久很久以来第一次，而那声音是Sherlock听过最让他开心的东西。 在Violet焦躁的哭声弄醒他们之前，Sherlock甚至没有意识到自己睡着了。“女王陛下需要观众。”John嘟哝着道歉。“我得上楼去。”他爬下床钻进浴室。Sherlock听见了马桶冲水的声音，John重新出来了，扔给他一条湿毛巾，穿上了自己的短裤。他走到Sherlock这一边然后吻了吻他。“恐怕我们在一起生活没法太浪漫。”“把她带下来。”Sherlock说，被自己专横的声音吓了一跳。“那你可就睡不着了。”Sherlock耸耸肩，他已经不可能睡着了。“我不是那么需要睡眠，而我想你陪着我。”John取笑般的盯着他，然后无奈的耸了耸肩表示“管他呢”。“好吧，我也不是那么想走。至少把你的裤子穿上。”Sherlock穿上了内裤，John上楼把Violet抱了下来。Violet有点骚动，但是还睡着。John把Violet安顿在床的另一边，侧蜷在她身旁。Sherlock从背后抱住他，手安放在John温暖的髋部。John回头对着Sherlock，Sherlock给了他一个深深地、悠长的吻，然后头落回枕头上。“对于火辣的第一次约会，这可不是什么符合常规的结尾。”John窃笑。“我们做事可从来不符合常规。”Sherlock指出。“就算我们现在开始上床，我也不觉得这一点会有所改变。”“不，我猜不会。”John困倦地嘟哝着。“晚安，Sherlock。”“晚安，John。”Sherlock对着他的头发低语。John几分钟就睡着了。Sherlock则醒着，看着他们两个睡觉。Violet小小的、长满金发的脑袋看着太像John。Sherlock感受到了他甚至没法理解的东西。看着他们因沉眠放松的脸，Sherlock突然被一种顿悟击中了，它是如此令人惊骇，几乎要完全令他不知所措。 John Watson不需要我为他而死。 他需要我为了他活下去。 随着时间流逝，Sherlock Holmes和他的医生，以及他们的女儿，年龄一点点地在增长。事实证明，Sherlock一直会是他原本的样子。他一直会为一次富有创意、精心策划的谋杀欢呼。他一直会享受深夜里穿越伦敦大街小巷的追逐。他一直会，在他脑内一个紧锁尘封的房间里，思念（只有一点点）可卡因纯粹冰冷的刺激。而如果他在直穿怀特查佩尔追逐一个谋杀犯之前停下来报警，如果他在钻进伦敦的下水道之前确保自己把自己的计划发短信告诉了某人，如果他把他所有的香烟都扔掉了（然后再买，买完再扔）或者有时候因为John说他会得坏血病甚至吃了点水果，这不代表他变得不同了。这意味着Sherlock Holmes最终决定活下去。 -The End-","categories":[{"name":"BBC

原文：https://sherlockbbc-fic.livejournal.com/12826.html?thread=68782874#t68782874 正文： Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现一张黄色的便利贴。 黑咖啡，两块糖。不加糖的茶给John，茶里面加几乎尝不出的一点牛奶。上面这么写着。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他下楼走进厨房时在他身体周围窸窣作响。他照着那张小纸上的指示泡了咖啡，黑咖啡，两块糖，然后小心地啜了一口。他喜欢这味道。 John还在睡觉，他得记着一会要给他泡茶。他拿来笔和纸，写下来，把便条留在了厨房流理台上。 茶，不加糖，一点奶。 当John叫他的时候，他在外面，在他的蜂房之间。不到一分钟之后，他听见身后草坪上有细微的脚步声，一只胳臂环在他细瘦的腰间。 “你已经在外面待了好久了。进来吧，天有点凉了，晚餐我做汤。” 你错了，Sherlock跟着John时想。John错了，不可能有那么久，十分钟之前他还在屋里泡咖啡。 在他们进厨房之前，John站在他面前，在Sherlock的额头上留下一个轻吻，试着抹平他皱起的眉头，接着便走向炉灶准备他们的晚餐。 Sherlock的目光落在流理台上，看到了另一张黄色的便利贴。茶，不加糖，一点奶。 他忘记给John泡茶了。 Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现一张蓝色的便利贴。 无聊无聊无聊无聊。无聊。给Lestrade打电话找个案子。无聊。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他下楼找手机时在他身体周围窸窣作响。它响了一次，两次，三次，Lestrade接了起来。Sherlock没给他任何说话的空儿。 “我感觉我的脑子就要烂掉了，我需要一个案子。” Lestrade在电话那头叹了口气。Sherlock没法看见他，不过他一定抬起了手，并疲惫地把它按在了额头上。 “Sherlock，我退休了，记得吗？我没法给你找案子，我已经没有权限再参与调查了。” 他困惑地皱起眉毛，想，Lestrade退休了？这讲不通啊，明明就在上周他们还在一起调查连环自杀案。 他向下看，在沙发前的咖啡桌上发现了另一张蓝色的便利贴。 照照镜子。记得照照镜子。 他走向暗色的壁炉，就在那，在壁炉台上面，他看见了自己的镜像：他的头发还是卷的，向来是卷的，因为一夜安眠而乱糟糟的，成了灰色。某几处还有几绺白色。他的前额和嘴周围的线条刻上了来自忧愁、阅历、岁月和人生的皱纹。他的眼睛还闪着光，明亮而专注，它们属于活了半个世纪之久的人。 “Sherlock？你在听吗？” 他把视线从镜子移开，落回咖啡桌，落回那张蓝色的便利贴。 “你老了。” Lestrade在电话里哼了一声，半是觉得有趣，半是疲倦。“是啊，我老了。” “我忘了。” “没关系，现在你记得了。” Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现一张绿色的便利贴。 Mycroft死了。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他走进浴室时在他身体周围窸窣作响。John正在那里冲澡。 “Mycroft死了。” John把水关掉，拉开浴帘，从附近拿起一条毛巾擦干自己。他从浴缸里迈出来，带着轻柔的担忧看着Sherlock，盯着他手里亮色的便利贴片刻。 “我知道。你忘了？” Sherlock看了他好一会：他忘了。他讨厌承认这个，不过没错，他忘了。 他点头。 “谁是Mycroft？” John看上去就像脸刚被人揍了一拳。他深吸一口气，眼睛上移盯着天花板没到一秒钟，然后回到原位看着Sherlock，他天才、疯狂、衰老、生了病的Sherlock。 “他是你的兄弟。你的哥哥，你们以前总是互相闹别扭不过谁都能看出来你们很在乎——”他不得不住口，因为他已经哽咽了。他眨着眼，一次，两次，三次。又几次眨眼，他的眼泪回到了原处。 “把水烧上，好吗？我去穿衣服，然后如果你想，我们可以说说Mycroft。” Sherlock看着John匆匆留给他一个小小的、忧伤的微笑。他好奇他为什么难过。他点了点头。 “好，我想我会愿意记起我的哥哥。” Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现一张粉色的便利贴。 扔掉冰箱里的头。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他下楼走向冰箱时在他身体周围窸窣作响。 “早上好。”John微笑着招呼他。 Sherlock无视了他，打开冰箱，扫视着里面的一切，移动着食物和瓶子。 “你在找什么？”John问他，声音里的耐心清晰可辨。 “那颗头。” 一声叹息。Sherlock能感觉到John走到他身后来，他的手探来握住他的，制止了他徒劳的搜索。 “冰箱里已经很多年没有人头了。” 他看着John，突然想起来：过去，外面在下雨，John打开冰箱，然后因为一个人头，一只脚和一颗心脏带着厌恶退后一步。他想起John，一个更年轻的John。那个John关上冰箱，摇着头，嘟哝着单独弄一个实验用冰箱，还有要Molly永远别再让Sherlock借走别的人体部件。 Sherlock快速走进客厅找他的手机，John紧紧地跟着他，担忧地皱起眉头。 “现在你在干什么？” “我才想起来，Molly。” “Molly怎么了？” “我从来没为头的事谢过她。我该给她打电话，那头很有用。 John看着Sherlock伏下身来在沙发底下找他的手机。他不想告诉他就在一周之前他们参加了Molly的葬礼。 Sherlock会想起来的，也许以后。 Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现一张紫色的便利贴。 John。不管发生什么，记住John。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他下楼走进小后院时在他身体周围窸窣作响。 John在那里，坐在一张椅子上读着报。他手里没有捧着茶，Sherlock忘了泡茶。他也没给自己泡咖啡。 他走近到他身后，弯下腰去，嘴唇轻轻擦过John的太阳穴。 “我忘了告诉你我爱你。” 他没法看见，可他能感觉到John在微笑。 Sherlock醒来，在床头柜上发现了一张黄色的便利贴。 别费事泡茶了。 他起来，穿上他蓝色的旧晨袍，不系带子，任它在他下楼时在他身体周围窸窣作响。 房子里寂静无声。 -The End- 译者语： 这还是我翻的第一篇文，没有检索到，就跟别人撞文了，不过那位译者应该是从这篇文的西语译文再转译的。 机缘巧合，现在我成了西语狗，另外之后还翻了另一篇老年痴呆AU，只不过换成John了，也算是某种程度上的相映成趣……","categories":[{"name":"BBC
